    "question": "is it true that if there was a lack of beds due to the virus, doctors would be less likely to save someone with diabetes, because they would be more likely to die??",
    "reference": "in brief: if you are dying everything is in motion and medical decisions are fluid, so you won't know until it happens. that's because a healthy person under 50 won't die (has maybe half a percent chance of dying) from covid-19, but a guy aged 70-80 has a 7-8% chance of dying from this... about the same as a non-elderly diabetic. that means the old guy and the diabetic both have about a 92-93% chance of not dying.

    "reference": "in brief: concern diabetes if controlled well typically should not be an issue. i realize there are some conflicting information, but i think the evidence shows that if diabetes controled your immune system still reacts appropriately and not an issue. arrythmia in itself not and issue. your age is 60 and that starts to be category of concern with 3% mortality rate. if you do not smoke that is the key. would you like to video or text chat with me?"
