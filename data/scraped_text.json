It shows how well you are controlling your blood sugar to help prevent complications from diabetes.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Two methods are available:\n- Blood drawn from a vein. This is done at a lab.\n- Finger stick. This can be done in your health care provider's office. Or, you may be prescribed a kit that you can use at home. Results by finger stick may differ slightly from blood drawn from a vein, but in most cases can also be used to monitor your treatment.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed. The food you have recently eaten does not affect the A1C test, so you do not need to fast to prepare for this blood test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWith a finger stick, you may feel slight pain.\nWith blood drawn from a vein, you may feel a slight pinch or some stinging when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have diabetes. It shows how well you are controlling your diabetes.\nThe test may also be used to screen for diabetes.\nAsk your provider how often you should have your A1C level tested. Usually, for people with diabetes, testing every 3 or 6 months is recommended.\nNormal Results\nThe following are the results when A1C is being used to diagnose diabetes:\n- Normal (no diabetes): Less than 5.7%\n- Pre-diabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%\n- Diabetes: 6.5% or higher\nIf you have diabetes, you and your provider will discuss the ideal range for you, which may vary based on your age. For many people, the goal is to keep the level below 7%.\nThe test result may be incorrect in people with anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, or certain blood disorders (thalassemia), or after a blood transfusion. Talk to your provider if you have any of these conditions. Certain medicines can also result in a false A1C level.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means that you have had a high blood sugar level over a period of weeks to months.\nIf your A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not already have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes.\nIf your level is above 7% and you have diabetes, it often means that your blood sugar is not as well controlled as would be ideal. You and your provider should determine your target A1C.\nMany labs now use the A1C to calculate an estimated average glucose (eAG). This estimate may be different from the average blood sugars you are recording from your glucose meter or continuous glucose monitor. Talk to your provider about what this means. The actual blood sugar readings are usually more reliable than the estimated average glucose based on the A1C.\nThe higher your A1C, the higher the risk that you will develop problems such as:\nIf your A1C stays high, talk to your provider about how best to manage your blood sugar.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n- Excessive bleeding\n- Multiple punctures to locate veins\n- Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n- Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n- Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nHbA1C test; Glycated hemoglobin test; Glycohemoglobin test; Hemoglobin A1C; Diabetes - A1C; Diabetic - A1C\nPatient Instructions\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be performed if:\n- You have or are at risk for type 1 diabetes\n- You appear to have an allergic response to insulin\n- Insulin no longer seems to control your diabetes\n- You are taking insulin to control your diabetes and your blood sugar level varies a lot, with both high and low numbers that can't be explained by the food you are eating relative to the timing of your insulin injections\nNormal Results\nNormally, there are no antibodies against insulin in your blood. Antibodies can be found in the blood of many people who are taking insulin to control diabetes.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe presence of IgG and IgM antibodies against insulin can be part of the testing that diagnoses you with type 1 diabetes.\nIf you develop anti-insulin antibodies, insulin may not work as well, or it may not work at all. As a result, your blood sugar can be very high. Or the antibodies can also put you at risk for low blood sugar.\nYour provider may suggest a different form of insulin to which your body may be less likely to form antibodies.\nIf the test shows a high level of IgE antibody against insulin, your body has developed an allergic response to the insulin.\n- This could put you at risk for skin reactions where you inject insulin. You can also develop more severe reactions that affect your blood pressure or breathing.\n- Medicines, such as antihistamines or low-dose injectable steroids, may help. Or you may need a treatment process called desensitization or a treatment to remove the antibodies from your blood.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003482.htm": "A blood sugar test measures the amount of a sugar called glucose in a sample of your blood.\nGlucose is a major source of energy for most cells of the body, including brain cells. Glucose is a building block for carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are found in fruit, cereal, bread, pasta, and rice. Carbohydrates are quickly turned into glucose in your body. This can raise your blood glucose level.\nThe hormone insulin made in the body helps control the blood glucose level.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThe test may be done in the following ways:\n- After you have not eaten anything for at least 8 hours (fasting)\n- At any time of the day (random)\n- Two hours after you drink a certain amount of glucose (2 hour post-prandial glucose test or oral glucose tolerance test)\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of diabetes. More than likely, the provider will order a fasting blood sugar test.\nThe blood glucose test is also used to monitor people who already have diabetes.\nThe test may also be done if you have:\n- An increase in how often you need to urinate\n- Recently gained a lot of weight\n- Blurred vision\n- Confusion or a change in the way you normally talk or behave\n- Fainting spells\n- Seizures (for the first time)\n- Unconsciousness or coma\nSCREENING FOR DIABETES\nThis test may also be used to screen a person for diabetes.\nHigh blood sugar and diabetes may not cause symptoms in the early stages. A fasting blood sugar test is the most common test done to screen for diabetes, usually starting at age 35. If you have no other diabetes risk factors, you should be tested every 3 years (in some cases, more often if your weight is rising).\nIf you're overweight and have any of the other risk factors below, ask your provider about getting tested at an earlier age and more often:\n- High blood sugar level on a previous test\n- Blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, or unhealthy cholesterol levels\n- History of heart disease\n- Member of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander)\n- Woman who has been previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes\n- Polycystic ovary disease (condition in which a woman has an imbalance of female sex hormones which may cause cysts in the ovaries)\n- Close relative with diabetes (such as a parent, brother, or sister)\n- Not physically active\nChildren age 10 and older who are overweight and have at least two of the risk factors listed above should be tested for type 2 diabetes every 3 years, even if they have no symptoms.\nIn 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was not enough evidence to recommend screening for type 2 diabetes in people 18 years old or younger. Some experts do advocate such screening for overweight children. Ask your child\u2019s provider what is best for them.\nNormal Results\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test, a level of 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L) is considered normal.\nIf you had a random blood glucose test, a normal result depends on when you last ate. Most of the time, the blood glucose level will be 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) or lower.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nBlood glucose measured by a blood test from a vein is considered more accurate than blood glucose measured from a fingerstick with a blood glucose meter, or blood glucose measured by a continuous glucose monitor.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test:\n- A level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) means you have impaired fasting glucose, a type of prediabetes. This increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and you should consult with your provider.\n- A level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher usually means you have diabetes.\nIf you had a random blood glucose test:\n- A level of 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) or higher often means you have diabetes.\n- Your provider will order a fasting blood glucose, A1C test, or glucose tolerance test, depending on your random blood glucose test result.\n- In someone who has diabetes, an abnormal result on the random blood glucose test may mean that the diabetes is not well controlled. Talk with your provider about your blood glucose goals if you have diabetes.\nOther medical problems can also cause a higher-than-normal blood glucose level, including:\n- Overactive thyroid gland\n- Pancreatic cancer\n- Swelling and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n- Stress due to trauma, stroke, heart attack, or surgery\n- Rare tumors, including pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, or glucagonoma\nA lower-than-normal blood glucose level (hypoglycemia) may be due to:\n- Hypopituitarism (a pituitary gland disorder)\n- Underactive thyroid gland or adrenal gland\n- Tumor in the pancreas (insulinoma - very rare)\n- Too little food\n- Too much insulin or other diabetes medicines\n- Liver or kidney disease\n- Weight loss after weight loss surgery\n- Vigorous exercise\nSome medicines can raise or lower your blood glucose level. Before having the test, tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking.\nFor some people, mainly those who are thin and young, a fasting blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) may be normal.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n- Excessive bleeding\n- Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n- Multiple punctures to locate veins\n- Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n- Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nRandom blood sugar; Blood sugar level; Fasting blood sugar; Glucose test; Diabetic screening - blood sugar test; Diabetes - blood sugar test\nPatient Instructions\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 2.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001214.htm": "Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.\nCauses\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both.\nTo understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed:\n- A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.\n- An organ in the upper abdomen, below and behind the stomach, called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.\nPeople with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:\n- Their pancreas does not make enough insulin\n- Their cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance)\n- Both of the above\nThere are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:\n- Type 1 diabetes is less common, accounting for 5% to 10% of people with diabetes in the United States. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin are damaged by an immune process and stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the immune process is unknown.\n- Type 2 diabetes is more common, accounting for 90% to 95% of people with diabetes in the United States. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.\n- There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Examples include LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a variant of type 1 diabetes), MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), and diabetes due to other illnesses.\nGestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes.\nIf your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease.\nSymptoms\nA high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:\n- Blurry vision\n- Excess thirst\n- Fatigue\n- Frequent urination\n- Hunger\n- Weight loss\nBecause type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period, usually weeks to months. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.\nAfter many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include:\n- Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, cataracts, and blindness\n- Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot\n- Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction\n- Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure\n- Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections\n- Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke\nExams and Tests\nA urine analysis may show high urine sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.\nYour health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL or higher (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.\nBlood tests:\n- Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two different tests, when the person is in their usual state of health. Levels from 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L to 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.\n- Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher.\n- Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher 2 hours after drinking a special 75 gram sugar drink (this test is used most often for type 2 diabetes and is rarely needed for type 1 diabetes).\nScreening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:\n- Overweight or obese adults (BMI of 25 kilograms per square meter or higher) starting at age 35 repeated every 3 years\n- Overweight women who have other risk factors such as high blood pressure who are planning to become pregnant\n- All adults age 35 or older, repeated every 3 years or at a younger age if the person has risk factors such as high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister, or brother with diabetes\nIn 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was not enough evidence to recommend screening for type 2 diabetes in people 18 years old or younger. Some experts do advocate such screening for overweight children. Ask your child\u2019s provider what is best for them.\nTreatment\nType 2 diabetes can sometimes be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating different foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery.\nThere is no cure for type 1 diabetes (except for a pancreas or islet cell transplant).\nTreating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves nutrition, activity and medicines to control blood sugar level.\nEveryone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES).\nGetting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk for kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.\nTo minimize diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider's instructions on managing your diabetes.\nSupport Groups\nMany resources can help you understand more about diabetes. If you have diabetes, you can also learn ways to manage your condition and prevent diabetes complications.\nMore information and support for people with diabetes and their families can be found at :\n- American Diabetes Association -- www.diabetes.org\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDiabetes is a lifelong disease for most people who have it.\nTight control of blood glucose can prevent or delay diabetes complications. But these problems can occur, even in people with good diabetes control.\nPossible Complications\nAfter many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems:\n- You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), cataracts, and light sensitivity. You could become blind.\n- Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body.\n- Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.\n- Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.\n- Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.\n- High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n- Your immune system can weaken, which can lead to frequent infections.\nPrevention\nKeeping an ideal body weight and an active lifestyle may prevent or delay the start of type 2 diabetes. If you're overweight, losing just 5% of your body weight can reduce your risk. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes.\nAt this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But there is promising research that shows type 1 diabetes may be delayed in some high risk people.\nAlternative Names\nDiabetes - type 1; Diabetes - type 2; Diabetes - gestational; Type 1 diabetes; Type 2 diabetes; Gestational diabetes; Diabetes mellitus\nPatient Instructions\nImages\n- Endocrine glands\n- Diabetic retinopathy\n- Islets of Langerhans\n- Pancreas\n- Insulin pump\n- Type I diabetes\n- Diabetic blood circulation in foot\n- Food and insulin release\n- Insulin production and diabetes\n- Monitoring blood glucose - Series\n- Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum - abdomen\n- Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum - leg\nReferences\nAtkinson MA, McGill DE, Dassau E, Laffel L.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000084.htm": "If you have diabetes, you may think that only vigorous exercise is helpful. But this is not true. Increasing your daily activity by any amount can help improve your health. And there are a lot of ways to add more activity to your day.\nIntroduction\nThere are many benefits to being active. Staying active can:\n- Help control your blood sugar\n- Help control your weight\n- Keep your heart, lungs, and blood vessels healthy\nWhile the focus of activity is often weight loss, you can benefit and become healthier from activity even without losing weight.\nStaying Active at Home\nOne of the best things you can do is get up and start moving. Any activity is better than no activity.\nClean the house. Walk around when you are on the phone. Take frequent, short breaks at least every 30 minutes to get up and walk around when using the computer.\nGet outside of your house and do chores, such as gardening, raking leaves, or washing the car. Play outside with your kids or grandchildren. Take the dog for a walk.\nStaying Active Outside the Home\nFor many people with diabetes, an activity program outside the home is a great option.\n- Talk to your health care provider about your plans and discuss what activities are right for you.\n- Visit the gym or a fitness facility and have an instructor show you how to use the equipment. Pick a gym that has an atmosphere you enjoy and gives you a number of options in terms of activities and locations.\n- When the weather is cold or wet, stay active by walking around in places like a mall.\n- Make sure you are using the right shoes and equipment.\n- Start slowly. A common mistake is to try and do too much too quickly. This can result in muscle and joint injury.\n- Involve friends or family. Activity in a group or with partners is usually more fun and motivating.\nShopping, Running Errands, and Working\nWhen you run errands:\n- Walk as much as you can.\n- If you do drive, park your car in the farthest part of the parking lot.\n- Do not use drive-up windows. Get out of your car and walk inside the restaurant or retailer.\nAt work:\n- Walk over to your co-workers instead of calling, texting, or sending them emails.\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator -- start with 1 floor up or 2 floors down and try to increase over time.\n- Stand up and move around while making phone calls.\n- Stretch or walk around instead of taking a coffee break or snacking.\n- During lunch, walk to the bank or post office, or do other errands that allow you to move around.\nAt the end of your commute, get off the train or bus one stop earlier and walk the rest of the way to work or home.\nIf you want to find out how much activity you are getting during the day, use a wearable activity monitor, a smartphone app, or a step counting device, called a pedometer. Once you know how many steps you average in a day, try to take more steps each day. Your goal for better health should be around 10,000 steps a day, or progressively more steps than you took the day before.\nHealth Risks\nThere are some health risks to beginning new activity programs. Always check with your provider before getting started.\nPeople with diabetes are at increased risk of having heart problems. They don't always sense the warning signs of a heart attack. Ask your provider if you need to be screened for heart disease, particularly if you:\n- Also have high blood pressure\n- Also have high cholesterol\n- Smoke\n- Have a history of heart disease in your family\nPeople with diabetes who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of having arthritis or other joint problems. Talk to your provider if you have had joint pain with activity in the past.\nSome people who are obese may develop skin rashes when they start new exercises. These can often be prevented by choosing the right clothing. If you develop a skin infection or rash, often in skin folds, talk to your provider and make sure it is treated before you continue being active.\nPeople with diabetes and nerve damage in their feet need to be extra careful when starting new activities. Check your feet daily for redness, blisters, or calluses that are starting to form. Always wear socks. Check your socks and shoes for rough spots, which can cause blisters or ulcers. Make sure your toenails are trimmed. Let your provider know right away if you have warmth, swelling, or redness across the top of your foot or your ankle.\nSome types of vigorous exercise (mostly heavier weight lifting) can damage your eyes if you already have diabetic eye disease. Be sure to get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.\nAlternative Names\nPhysical activity - diabetes; Exercise - diabetes\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 5.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000079.htm": "Waiting too long to get medical care when you are sick can lead to getting much sicker. When you have diabetes, a delay in getting care can be life threatening. Even a minor cold can make your diabetes harder to control. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to more serious health problems.\nWhat to Expect at Home\nWhen you are sick, insulin does not work as well in your cells and your blood sugar level can be higher. This can happen even if you are taking the normal doses of your medicines, including insulin.\nWhen you are sick, keep a close watch on diabetes warning signs. These are:\n- High blood sugar that will not come down with treatment\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Low blood sugar that will not rise after you eat\n- Confusion or changes in how you normally behave\nIf you have any of these warning signs and cannot treat them yourself, contact your health care provider right away. Make sure your family members also know the warning signs.\nSick-day Plan\nDiscuss with your provider, before you are sick, how best to handle illnesses. Typical sick day plans are below.\nCheck your blood sugar more often than usual (every 2 to 4 hours). Try to keep your blood sugar at less than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). There may be times when you need to check your blood sugar every hour. Write down or record all your blood sugar levels, the time of each test, and the medicines you have taken.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, check your urine ketones every time you urinate.\nEat small meals often. Even if you are not eating as much, your blood sugar can still get very high. If you use insulin, you may even need extra insulin injections or higher doses.\nDo not do vigorous exercise when you are sick.\nIf you take insulin, you should also have a glucagon emergency treatment kit prescribed by your provider. Always have this kit available.\nDrink Lots of Fluids\nDrink plenty of sugar-free fluids to keep your body from getting dried out (dehydrated). Drink at least twelve 8-ounce (oz) cups (3 liters) of fluid a day.\nFeeling sick often makes you not want to eat or drink, which, surprisingly, can lead to a higher blood sugar.\nFluids you can drink if you are dehydrated include:\n- Water\n- Club soda\n- Diet soda (caffeine-free)\n- Tomato juice\n- Chicken broth\nIf your blood sugar is less than 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) or falling quickly, it is OK to drink fluids that have sugar in them. Try to check their effect on your blood sugar in the same way you check how other foods affect your blood sugar.\nFluids you can drink if your blood sugar is low include:\n- Apple juice\n- Orange juice\n- Grapefruit juice\n- Sports drink\n- Tea with honey\n- Lemon-lime drinks\n- Ginger ale\nIf you throw up, do not drink or eat anything for 1 hour. Rest, but do not lie flat. After 1 hour, take sips of soda, such as ginger ale, every 10 minutes. If vomiting persists, contact or see your provider.\nEating When You are Sick\nWhen you have an upset stomach, try to eat small meals. Try carbohydrates, such as:\n- Bagels or bread\n- Cooked cereal\n- Mashed potatoes\n- Noodle or rice soup\n- Saltines\n- Fruit-flavored gelatin\n- Graham crackers\nMany foods have the right amount of carbohydrates (about 15 grams) for your sick-day diet. Remember, on sick days it is OK to eat some foods you might not normally eat, if you cannot eat your regular foods. Always check the label of foods to be sure you know their carbohydrate content. Some foods to try are:\n- One half cup (120 milliliters, mL) apple juice\n- One half cup (120 mL) regular soft drink (non-diet, caffeine free)\n- One fruit-flavored frozen pop (1 stick)\n- Five small hard candies\n- One slice of dry toast\n- One half cup (120 mL) cooked cereal\n- Six saltine crackers\n- One half cup (120 mL) frozen yogurt\n- One cup (240 mL) sports drink\n- One half cup (120 mL) regular ice cream (if you are not throwing up)\n- One quarter cup (60 mL) sherbet\n- One quarter cup (60 mL) regular pudding (if you are not throwing up)\n- One half cup (120 mL) regular fruit-flavored gelatin\n- One cup (240 mL) yogurt (not frozen), sugar-free or plain\n- Milkshake made with one half cup (120 mL) low-fat milk and one quarter cup (60 mL) ice cream mixed in a blender (if you are not throwing up)\nWhen you are sick, you should try to eat the same amount of carbohydrates that you normally do. If possible, follow your regular diet. If you are having a hard time swallowing, eat soft foods.\nIf you have already taken your insulin and are sick to your stomach, drink enough liquids with the same amount of carbohydrates that you would normally eat. If you cannot keep food or liquids down, go to the emergency room for treatment. You will receive intravenous (IV) fluids.\nIf you have a cold or fever, use your sick day plan or contact your provider.\nDiabetes Medicines\nMost of the time, you should take all of your medicines as you usually do. Do not skip or double up on any medicine unless your provider tells you to.\nIf you cannot eat your normal amount of carbohydrates, use your sick day plan or contact your provider. You may need to make a change in your insulin dose or in the dose of your diabetes pills or other injections. You may also need to do this if your illness is making your blood sugar higher than normal.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nBeing sick increases the risk of more serious emergencies seen with diabetes.\nContact your provider if you have:\n- Blood sugar higher than 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) for more than 1 day\n- Moderate-to-large ketones with your urine tests\n- Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 4 hours\n- Any severe pain or chest pain\n- A fever of 100\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C) or higher\n- Trouble moving your arms or legs\n- Vision, speech, or balance problems\n- Confusion or new memory problems\nIf your provider does not contact you back right away, you may need to go to the emergency room. This is particularly important if you are vomiting or have diarrhea for more than 4 hours.\nAlternative Names\nSick-day management - diabetes; Diabetes - sick day management; Insulin resistance - sick day management; Ketoacidosis - sick day management; Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome - sick day management\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 4.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000083.htm": "Exercise is an important part of managing your diabetes. If you are obese or overweight, exercise can help you manage your weight.\nExercise will Help Your Diabetes\nExercise can help lower your blood sugar without medicines. It reduces your risk of heart disease. Exercise can also lessen the symptoms of depression and reduce stress.\nBut be patient. It may take several months of regular exercising before you see changes in your health. It is important to understand that exercise can benefit your health even if it does not cause much weight loss.\nTalk to Your Doctor First\nYour health care provider should make sure your exercise program is safe for you. An exercise program is safe for most people with diabetes. Your provider may ask about symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg pain that you may get when you walk upstairs or up a hill. In rare cases, your provider will order tests to make sure that you can exercise safely without damaging your heart.\nIf you take medicines that lower your blood sugar, exercise can make your blood sugar go too low. Talk to your provider or nurse about how to take your medicines when you exercise or how to adjust the doses to prevent low blood sugars.\nSome types of vigorous exercise can make your eyes worse if you already have diabetic eye disease. Get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.\nAfter you start your exercise program, contact your provider if you have any of the following:\n- Feel faint, have chest pain, or feel short of breath when you exercise\n- Feel pain or numbness in your feet. Also contact your provider if you have sores or blisters on your feet\n- Your blood sugar gets too low or too high during or after exercising\nGetting Started\nStart with walking. If you are out of shape, start by walking for 5 to 10 minutes a day.\nTry to set a goal of fast walking. You should do this for 30 to 45 minutes, at least 5 days a week. In order to lose weight, the amount of exercise may need to be greater. So do more if you can. Swimming or exercise classes are also good.\nIf you don't have a safe place to walk, or have pain when walking, you can start with body weight exercises in your home. Talk to your provider about which exercises are right for you.\nWear a bracelet or necklace that says you have diabetes. Tell coaches and exercise partners that you have diabetes. Always have fast-acting sources of sugar with you, such as juice or hard candy. Carry a cell phone with emergency phone numbers with you, as well.\nDrink plenty of water. Do this before, during, and after exercising. Try to exercise at the same time of day, for the same amount of time, and at the same level. This will make your blood sugar easier to control. If your schedule is less regular, exercising at different times of the day is still better than not exercising at all.\nTry to avoid sitting for more than 30 minutes at a time. Get up and stretch. Walk or do some quick exercises like lunges, squats, or wall push-ups.\nYour Blood Sugar and Exercise\nThe blood sugar response to exercise is not always easy to predict. Different types of exercises can make blood sugar go up or down. Most of the time, your response to any specific exercise will be the same. Testing your blood sugar more often is the safest plan.\nCheck your blood sugar before you exercise. Also, check it during exercise if you are working out for more than 45 minutes, especially if this is an exercise you have not done regularly.\nCheck your blood sugar again right after exercise, and later on. Exercise can cause your blood sugar to decrease for up to 12 hours after you are done.\nIf you use insulin, ask your provider when and what you should eat before you exercise. Also, find out how to adjust your insulin dose when you exercise.\nDo not inject insulin in a part of your body that you are exercising, such as the shoulders or thighs.\nKeep a snack nearby that can raise your blood sugar quickly. Examples are:\n- Five or six small soft candies\n- One tablespoon (tbsp), or 15 grams, of sugar, plain or dissolved in water\n- One tbsp, or 15 milliliters (mL) of honey or syrup\n- Three or four glucose tablets\n- One half of a 12-ounce can (355 mL) of regular, non-diet soda or sports drink\n- One half cup (4 ounces or 118 mL) of fruit juice\nHave a larger snack if you will be exercising more than usual. You can also have more frequent snacks. You may need to adjust your medicine if you are planning unusual exercise.\nIf exercise frequently causes your blood sugar to be low, talk with your provider. You may need to lower the dose of your medicine.\nYour Feet and Exercise\nAlways check your feet and shoes for any problems before and after exercise. You might not feel pain in your feet because of your diabetes. You may not notice a sore or blister on your foot. Contact your provider if you notice any changes on your feet. Small problems can become serious if they go untreated.\nWear socks that keep moisture away from your feet. Also, wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes.\nIf you have redness, swelling and warmth across the middle of your foot or ankle after exercise let your provider know right away. This can be a sign of a joint problem that is more common in people with diabetes, called Charcot foot.\nAlternative Names\nExercise - diabetes; Exercise - type 1 diabetes; Exercise - type 2 diabetes\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 5.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000964.htm": "Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Diabetes is a complicated disease. If you have diabetes, or know anyone who has it, you may have questions about the disease. There are many popular myths about diabetes and its management. Here are some facts you should know about diabetes.\nInformation\nMyth: No one in my family has diabetes, so I won't get the disease.\nFact: It's true that having a parent or sibling with diabetes increases your risk for getting diabetes. In fact, family history is a risk factor for both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, many people with diabetes have no close family members with diabetes.\nLifestyle choices and certain conditions can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes. These include:\n- Being overweight or obese\n- Having prediabetes\n- Polycystic ovary disease\n- Gestational diabetes\n- Being of Hispanic/Latino American, African American, American Indian, or Alaska Native descent (some Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans are also at risk)\n- Being age 45 or older\nYou can help reduce your risk by staying at a healthy weight, exercising most days of the week, and eating a healthy diet.\nMyth: I will likely develop diabetes because I am overweight.\nFact: It is true that excess weight increases your chance of having diabetes. However, many people who are overweight or obese never develop diabetes. And people who are normal weight or only a little overweight do develop diabetes. Your best bet is to take steps to lower your risk by using nutritional changes and physical activity to lose excess weight.\nMyth: I eat a lot of sugar, so I am worried I'll get diabetes.\nFact: Eating sugar does not cause diabetes. But you should still cut back on sweets and sugary beverages.\nIt's not surprising that people get confused about whether sugar causes diabetes. This confusion may come from the fact that when you eat food, it is converted into a sugar called glucose. Glucose, also called blood sugar, is a source of energy for the body. Insulin moves glucose from the blood into the cells so it can be used for energy. With diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin, or the body does not use insulin well. As a result, the extra sugar stays in the blood, so the blood glucose (blood sugar) level increases.\nFor people who do not have diabetes, the main problem with eating a lot of sugar and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is that it can make you overweight. And being overweight does increase your risk for diabetes.\nMyth: I was told I have diabetes, so now I'll have to eat a special diet.\nFact: People with diabetes eat the same foods that everyone eats. In fact, The American Diabetes Association no longer recommends specific amounts of carbohydrate, fat, or protein to eat. But they do suggest that people with diabetes get their carbohydrates from vegetables, whole grains, fruits, and legumes. Avoid foods that are high in fat, sodium, and sugar. These recommendations are similar to what everyone should be eating.\nIf you have diabetes, work with your health care provider to develop a meal plan that works best for you and that you will be able to follow consistently over time. A healthy and balanced meal plan with a healthy lifestyle will help you manage diabetes.\nMyth: I have diabetes, so I can never eat sweets.\nFact: Sweets are full of simple sugars, which increase the amount of glucose in your blood more than other foods. But they are not off limits for people with diabetes, as long as you plan for them. It's best to save sweets for special occasions or as a treat. You can eat small amounts of sugar in place of other carbohydrates usually eaten at a meal. If you take insulin your provider may instruct you to take higher doses than normal when you do eat sweets.\nMyth: My provider put me on insulin. This means I am not doing a good job managing my blood sugar.\nFact: People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin because their body no longer produces this important hormone. Type 2 diabetes is progressive, which means that the body makes less insulin over time. So over time, exercise, diet changes, and oral medicines or non-insulin injectable medicines may not be enough to keep your blood sugar in control. Then you need to use insulin to keep blood sugar in a healthy range.\nMyth: It is not safe to exercise with diabetes.\nFact: Getting regular exercise is an important part of managing diabetes. Exercise helps boost your body's sensitivity to insulin. It can also help lower your A1C, a test that helps tell how well your diabetes is controlled.\nA good goal is to aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous exercise like brisk walking. Include two sessions a week of strength training as part of your exercise routine. If you haven't exercised in a while, walking at a brisk pace (you can talk, but not sing) is a great way to slowly build your fitness.\nTalk to your provider to make sure your exercise program is safe for you. Depending on how well-controlled your diabetes is, you will need to prevent and monitor for problems with your eyes, heart, and feet. Also, learn how to take your medicines when you exercise or how to adjust the dosage of medicines, such as insulin, to prevent low blood sugar.\nMyth: I have borderline diabetes, so I don't need to worry.\nFact:Prediabetes is the term used for those whose blood sugar levels are not in the diabetes range but are too high to be called normal. Prediabetes means that you are at high risk for developing diabetes within 10 years. You may be able to lower your blood sugar to normal levels by lowering your body weight and exercising 150 minutes a week.\nTalk to your provider about your risk for diabetes and what you can do to lower your risk.\nMyth: I can stop taking diabetes medicines once my blood sugar is under control.\nFact: Some people with type 2 diabetes are able to control their blood sugar without medicine by losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. But diabetes is a progressive disease, and over time, even if you are doing all you can to stay healthy, you may need medicine to keep your blood sugar within your target range.\nAlternative Names\nDiabetes - common myths and facts; High blood sugar myths and facts\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000082.htm": "People who take control of their own diabetes care by eating healthy foods, living an active lifestyle, and taking medicines as prescribed often have good control of their blood sugar levels. Still, regular health checkups and tests are needed. These visits give you a chance to:\n- Ask your health care provider questions\n- Learn more about your diabetes and what you can do to keep your blood sugar in your target range\n- Make sure you are taking your medicines the right way\nSee Your Doctor\nSee your diabetes provider every 3 to 6 months. During this visit, your provider should check your:\n- Blood pressure\n- Weight\n- Feet\nSee your dentist every 6 months, also.\nIf you are taking insulin or other injections, your provider will also examine your skin to look for signs of reactions to insulin at your injection sites. These may be hard areas or areas where fat under the skin has formed a lump.\nYour provider may also check your abdomen for signs of an enlarged liver.\nEye Exams\nAn eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) should check your eyes every year. See an eye doctor who takes care of people with diabetes.\nIf you have eye problems because of diabetes, you will probably see your eye doctor more often.\nFoot Exams\nYour provider should check the pulses in your feet and your reflexes at least once a year. Your provider should also look for:\n- Calluses\n- Infections\n- Sores\n- Thick toenails\n- Loss of feeling anywhere in your feet (peripheral neuropathy), done with a tool called a monofilament\nIf you have had foot ulcers before, see your provider every 3 to 6 months. It is always a good idea to ask your provider to check your feet.\nHemoglobin A1C Tests\nAn A1C lab test shows how well you are controlling your blood sugar levels over a 3-month period.\nThe normal level is less than 5.7%. Most people with diabetes should aim for an A1C of less than 7%. Some people have a higher target. Your provider will help decide what your target should be.\nHigher A1C numbers mean that your blood sugar is higher and that you may be more likely to have complications from your diabetes.\nCholesterol\nA cholesterol profile test measures cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. You should have this kind of test in the morning, after not eating since the night before.\nMost adults with type 2 diabetes should have this test once a year. People age 40 or over with high cholesterol or on medicines to control their cholesterol may have this test more often.\nBlood Pressure\nBlood pressure should be measured at every visit. Talk to your provider about what your blood pressure goal should be.\nKidney Tests\nOnce a year, you should have a urine test that looks for a protein called albumin.\nYour provider will also have you take a blood test every year that measures how well your kidneys work.\nAlternative Names\nRoutine diabetes tests; Diabetes - prevention\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 4.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000660.htm": "To give an insulin injection, you need to fill the right syringe with the right amount of insulin, decide where to give the injection, and know how to give the injection.\nYour health care provider or a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) will teach you all of these steps, watch you practice, and answer your questions. You may take notes to remember the details. Use the information below as a reminder.\nGetting Ready\nKnow the name and dose of each medicine to give. The type of insulin should match the type of syringe:\n- Standard insulin contains 100 units in 1 milliliter (mL). This is also called U-100 insulin. Most insulin syringes are marked for giving you U-100 insulin. Every small notch on a standard 1 mL insulin syringe is 1 unit of insulin.\n- More concentrated insulins are available. These include U-500 and U-300. Because U-500 syringes may be difficult to find, your provider may give you instructions for using U-500 insulin with U-100 syringes. Insulin syringes or concentrated insulin are now widely available. Do not mix or dilute concentrated insulin with any other insulin.\n- Some types of insulin can be mixed with each other in one syringe, but many cannot be mixed. Check with your provider, CDCES, or pharmacist about this. Some insulins will not work if mixed with other insulins.\n- If you are having trouble seeing the markings on the syringe, talk to your provider or CDCES. Magnifiers are available that clip to your syringe to make the markings easier to see.\n- Many types of insulin come in an injection system called an insulin pen. Ask your provider if this system would be good for you.\nOther general tips:\n- Always try to use the same brands and types of supplies. Do not use expired insulin.\n- Insulin should be given at room temperature. If you have stored it in the refrigerator or cooler bag, take it out 30 minutes before the injection. Once you have started using a vial of insulin, it can be kept at room temperature for 28 days.\n- Gather your supplies: insulin, needles, syringes, alcohol wipes, and a container for used needles and syringes.\nFilling the Syringe - one Type of Insulin\nTo fill a syringe with one type of insulin:\n- Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.\n- Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin. Make sure it is not expired.\n- The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.\n- Intermediate-acting insulin (N or NPH) is cloudy and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. Do not shake the bottle. This can make the insulin clump.\n- Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.\n- If the insulin vial has a plastic cover, take it off. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. Do not blow on it.\n- Know the dose of insulin you are going to use. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of medicine you want.\n- Put the needle into and through the rubber top of the insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle.\n- Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down.\n- With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.\n- Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the insulin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.\n- When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything.\nFilling the Syringe - two Types of Insulin\nTo fill a syringe with two types of insulin:\n- Never mix two types of insulin in one syringe unless you are told to do this. You will also be told which insulin to draw up first. Always do it in that order.\n- Your doctor will tell you how much of each insulin you will need. Add these two numbers together. This is the amount of insulin you should have in the syringe before injecting it.\n- Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.\n- Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin.\n- The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.\n- Intermediate-acting insulin (N or NPH) is cloudy and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. Do not shake the bottle. This can make the insulin clump.\n- Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.\n- If the vial has a plastic cover, take it off. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. Do not blow on it.\n- Know the dose of each insulin you are going to use. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of the longer-acting insulin.\n- Put the needle into the rubber top of that insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle. Remove the needle from the bottle.\n- Put the air in the short-acting insulin bottle the same way as the previous two steps above.\n- Keep the needle in the short-acting bottle and turn the bottle upside down.\n- With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.\n- Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the insulin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.\n- When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Look at it again to make sure you have the right dose.\n- Put the needle into the rubber top of the longer-acting insulin bottle.\n- Turn the bottle upside down. With the tip of the needle in the liquid, slowly pull back on the plunger to exactly the right dose of long-acting insulin. Do not draw extra insulin in the syringe, since you should not push the mixed insulin back into the bottle.\n- Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Remove the needle from the bottle before you push out the air.\n- Make sure you have the right total dose of insulin. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything.\nGiving the Injection\nChoose where to give the injection. Keep a chart of places you have used, so you do not inject the insulin in the same place all the time. Ask your provider or CDCES for a chart.\n- Keep your shots 1 inch (2.5 centimeters, cm) away from scars and 2 inches (5 cm) away from your navel.\n- Do not put a shot in a spot that is bruised, swollen, or tender.\n- Do not put a shot in a spot that is lumpy, firm, or numb (this is a very common cause of insulin not working the way it should).\nThe site you choose for the injection should be clean and dry. If your skin is visibly dirty, clean it with soap and water. Do not use an alcohol wipe on your injection site.\nThe insulin needs to go into the fat layer under the skin.\n- Pinch the skin and put the needle in at a 45\u00ba angle.\n- If your skin tissues are thicker, you may be able to inject straight up and down (90\u00ba angle). Check with your provider before doing this.\n- Push the needle all the way into the skin. Let go of the pinched skin. Inject the insulin slowly and steadily until it is all in.\n- Leave the syringe in place for 5 seconds after injecting.\nPull the needle out at the same angle it went in. Put the syringe down. There is no need to recap it. If insulin tends to leak from your injection site, press the injection site for a few seconds after the injection. If this happens often, check with your provider. You may change the site or the injection angle.\nPlace the needle and syringe in a safe hard container. Close the container, and keep it safely away from children and animals. Never reuse needles or syringes.\nIf you're injecting more than 50 to 90 units of insulin in one injection, your provider may tell you to split the doses either at different times or using different sites for the same injection. This is because bigger volumes of insulin may get weakened without being absorbed. Your provider may also talk to you about switching to a more concentrated type of insulin.\nStoring Your Insulin and Supplies\nAsk your pharmacist how you should store your insulin so it doesn't go bad. Never put insulin in the freezer. Don't store it in your car on warm days.\nAlternative Names\nDiabetes - insulin injection; Diabetic - insulin shot\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 9.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003466.htm": "The glucose tolerance test is a lab test to check how your body moves sugar from the blood into tissues like muscle and fat. The test is often used to diagnose diabetes.\nTests to screen for diabetes during pregnancy are similar, but are done differently.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe most common glucose tolerance test is the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\nBefore the test begins, when you have had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours, a sample of blood will be taken.\nYou will then be asked to drink a liquid containing a certain amount of glucose (usually 75 grams). Your blood will be taken again every 30 to 60 minutes after you drink the solution.\nThe test may take up to 3 hours.\nA similar test is the intravenous (IV) glucose tolerance test (IGTT). It is rarely used, and is never used to diagnose diabetes. In one version of the IGTT, glucose is injected into your vein for 3 minutes. Blood insulin levels are measured before the injection, and again at 1 and 3 minutes after the injection. The timing may vary. This IGTT is almost always used for research purposes only.\nA similar test is used in the diagnosis of growth hormone excess (acromegaly) when both glucose and growth hormone are measured after the glucose drink is consumed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMake sure you eat normally for several days before the test.\nDo not eat or drink anything for at least 8 hours before the test. You cannot eat during the test.\nAsk your health care provider if any of the medicines you take can affect the test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDrinking the glucose solution is similar to drinking very sweet soda.\nSerious side effects from this test are very uncommon. With the blood test, some people feel nauseated, sweaty, lightheaded, or may even feel short of breath or faint after drinking the glucose. Tell your provider if you have a history of these symptoms related to blood tests or medical procedures.\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGlucose is the sugar the body uses for energy. People with untreated diabetes have high blood glucose levels.\nMost often, the first tests used to diagnose diabetes in people who are not pregnant are:\n- Fasting blood glucose level: diabetes is diagnosed if it is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher, on 2 different tests, done when when in a person's normal state of health\n- Hemoglobin A1C test: diabetes is diagnosed if the test result is 6.5% or higher\nGlucose tolerance tests are also used to diagnose diabetes. The OGTT is used to screen for or diagnose diabetes in people with a fasting blood glucose level that is high, but is not high enough (at or above 126 mg/dL or 7 mmol/L) to meet the diagnosis for diabetes.\nAbnormal glucose tolerance (blood sugar goes too high during the glucose challenge) is an earlier sign of diabetes than an abnormal fasting glucose.\nNormal Results\nNormal blood values for a 75 gram OGTT used to check for type 2 diabetes in those who are not pregnant:\nFasting -- 60 to 99 mg/dL (3.3 to 5.5 mmol/L)\n1 hour -- Less than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)\n2 hours -- This value is used to make the diagnosis of diabetes.\n- Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal\n- From 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.1 mmol/L) is considered impaired glucose tolerance\n- A level of 200 mg/dL (11.1mmol/L) or higher is diagnostic of diabetes\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA glucose level that is higher than normal may mean you have pre-diabetes or diabetes:\n- A 2-hour value of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 and 11.1 mmol/L) is called impaired glucose tolerance. Your provider may call this pre-diabetes. It means you are at increased risk of developing diabetes over time.\n- Any glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher is used to diagnose diabetes.\nSerious stress to the body, such as from trauma, stroke, heart attack, or surgery, can raise your blood glucose level. Vigorous exercise can lower your blood glucose level.\nSome medicines can raise or lower your blood glucose level. Before having the test, tell your provider about any medicines you are taking.\nRisks\nYou may have some of the symptoms listed above under the heading titled \"How the Test will Feel.\"\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n- Excessive bleeding\n- Multiple punctures to locate veins\n- Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n- Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n- Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nOral glucose tolerance test - non-pregnant; OGTT - non-pregnant; Diabetes - glucose tolerance test; Diabetic - glucose tolerance test\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 2.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003581.htm": "The glucose urine test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in a urine sample. The presence of glucose in the urine is called glycosuria or glucosuria.\nThe glucose level can also be measured in other bodily fluids using a blood test or a cerebrospinal fluid test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color of the dipstick changes to tells the provider the level of glucose in your urine.\nIf needed, your provider may ask you to collect your urine at home over 24 hours. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines can change the result of this test. Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking. DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test was commonly used to test for and monitor diabetes in the past. Now, blood tests to measure glucose level in the blood are easy to do and are usually used instead of the glucose urine test.\nThe glucose urine test may be ordered when your provider suspects renal glycosuria. This is a rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when the blood glucose level is normal.\nNormal Results\nGlucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed.\nNormal glucose range in urine: 0 to 0.8 mmol/l (0 to 15 mg/dL)\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher than normal levels of glucose may occur with:\n- Diabetes: Small increases in urine glucose levels after a large meal are not always a cause for concern.\n- Pregnancy: Up to half of women have glucose in their urine at some time during pregnancy. Glucose in the urine may mean that a woman has gestational diabetes.\n- Renal glycosuria: A rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when blood glucose levels are normal.\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nUrine sugar test; Urine glucose test; Glucosuria test; Glycosuria test\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000332.htm": "High blood sugar is also called high blood glucose, or hyperglycemia.\nHigh blood sugar almost always happens in people who have diabetes. High blood sugar occurs when:\n- Your body makes too little insulin.\n- Your body does not respond to the signal insulin is sending.\nInsulin is a hormone that helps the body move glucose (sugar) from the blood into muscle or fat, where it is stored for later use when energy is needed.\nSometimes high blood sugar occurs due to stress from surgery, infection, trauma, or medicines. After the stress is over, blood sugar returns to normal.\nSymptoms of High Blood Sugar\nSymptoms of high blood sugar can include:\n- Being very thirsty or having a dry mouth\n- Having blurry vision\n- Having dry skin\n- Feeling weak or tired\n- Needing to urinate a lot, or needing to get up more often than usual at night to urinate\nYou may have other, more serious symptoms if your blood sugar becomes very high or remains high for a long time. Over time, high blood sugar weakens your immune system and makes it more likely for you to get infections.\nWhat to Think About When Your Blood Sugar is High\nHigh blood sugar can harm you. If your blood sugar is high, you need to know how to bring it down. If you have diabetes, here are some questions to ask yourself when your blood sugar is high:\n- Are you eating right?\n- Are you eating too much?\n- Have you been following your diabetes meal plan?\n- Did you have a meal or a snack with a lot of carbohydrates, starches, or simple sugars?\nAre you taking your diabetes medicines correctly?\n- Has your health care provider changed your medicines?\n- If you take insulin, have you been taking the correct dose? Is the insulin expired? Or has it been stored in a hot or cold place?\n- Are you afraid of having low blood sugar? Is that causing you to eat too much or take too little insulin or other diabetes medicine?\n- Have you injected insulin into a scar or overused area? Have you been rotating sites? Was the injection into a lump or numb spot under the skin?\nWhat else has changed?\n- Have you been less active than usual?\n- Do you have a fever, cold, flu, or another illness?\n- Are you dehydrated?\n- Have you had some stress?\n- Have you been checking your blood sugar regularly?\n- Have you gained weight?\n- Have you started taking any new medicines such as for high blood pressure or other medical problems?\n- Have you had an injection into a joint or other area with a glucocorticoid medicine?\nPreventing High Blood Sugar\nTo prevent high blood sugar, you will need to:\n- Follow your meal plan\n- Stay physically active\n- Take your diabetes medicines as instructed\nYou and your provider will:\n- Set a target goal for your blood sugar levels for different times during the day. This helps you manage your blood sugar.\n- Decide how often you need to check your blood sugar at home.\nIf your blood sugar is higher than your goals over 3 days and you don't know why, check your urine for ketones.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000331.htm": "Immunizations (vaccines or vaccinations) help protect you from some diseases. When you have diabetes, you're more likely to get severe infections because your immune system doesn't work as well. Vaccines can prevent illnesses that can be very serious and can put you in the hospital.\nVaccines usually have an inactive, small part of a certain germ. This germ is often a virus or bacteria. After you get a vaccine, your body learns to attack that virus or bacteria if you are infected. This means you have less of a chance of getting sick than if you did not get the vaccine. Or you may just have a much milder illness.\nBelow are some of the vaccines you need to know about. Ask your health care provider which are right for you.\nPneumococcal Vaccine\nPneumococcal vaccine can help protect you from serious infections due to the pneumococcal bacteria. These infections include:\n- In the blood (bacteremia)\n- Of the covering of the brain (meningitis)\n- In the lungs (pneumonia)\nYou need at least one shot. A second shot may be needed if you had the first shot more than 5 years ago and you are now age 65 years or older.\nMost people have no or only minor side effects from the vaccine. You may have some pain and redness at the site where you get the shot.\nThis vaccine has a very small chance of a serious reaction.\nFlu Shot\nThe flu (influenza) vaccine helps protect you from the flu. Each year, the type of flu virus that makes people sick is different. This is why you should get a flu shot every year. The best time to get the shot is in the early fall, so that you'll be protected all flu season, which usually lasts mid-fall until the following spring.\nPeople with diabetes who are 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine each year.\nThe vaccine is given as a shot (injection). Flu shots can be given to healthy people 6 months or older. One type of shot is injected into a muscle (often the upper arm muscle). Another type is injected just under the skin. Your provider can tell you which shot is right for you.\nIn general, you should not get a flu shot if you:\n- Have a severe allergy to chickens or egg protein\n- Currently have a fever or illness that is more than \"just a cold\"\n- Had a bad reaction to a previous flu vaccine\nThis vaccine has a very small chance of a serious reaction.\nHepatitis B Vaccine\nThe hepatitis B vaccine helps protect you from getting a liver infection due to the hepatitis B virus. People with diabetes ages 19 through 59 years should get the vaccine. Your provider can tell you if this vaccine is right for you.\nOther Important Vaccines\nOther vaccines that you may need are:\n- COVID-19\n- Hepatitis A\n- Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis)\n- MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)\n- Herpes zoster (shingles)\n- Polio\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee website. 5.

A low level (or no C-peptide) indicates that your pancreas is producing little or no insulin.\n- A low level may be normal if you have not eaten recently. Your blood sugar and insulin levels would naturally be low then.\n- A low level is abnormal if your blood sugar is high and your body should be making insulin at that time.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes, obesity, or insulin resistance may have a high C-peptide level. This means their body is producing a lot of insulin to keep (or try to keep) their blood sugar normal.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n- Bleeding\n- Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n- Multiple punctures to try to locate veins\n- Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n- Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nC-peptide\nImages\nReferences\nAtkinson MA, McGill DE, Dassau E, Laffel L.

Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nKetones are substances produced in the liver when fat cells break down in the blood. This test is used to diagnose ketoacidosis. This is a life-threatening problem that affects people who:\n- Have diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA). It occurs when the body cannot use sugar (glucose) as a fuel source because there is not enough insulin. Fat is used for fuel instead. When fat breaks down, waste products called ketones build up in the body.\n- Drink large amounts of alcohol (alcoholic ketoacidosis).\nNormal Results\nA normal test result is negative. This means there are no ketones in the blood.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA test result is positive if ketones are found in the blood. This may indicate:\n- Alcoholic ketoacidosis\n- Diabetic ketoacidosis\n- Starvation\n- Uncontrolled blood glucose in people with diabetes\nOther reasons ketones are found in the blood include:\n- A diet low in carbohydrates can increase ketones (sometimes called a ketogenic diet).\n- After receiving anesthesia for surgery\n- Glycogen storage disease (condition in which the body can't break down glycogen, a form of sugar that is stored in the liver and muscles)\nRisks\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken.

The kit contains dipsticks coated with chemicals that react with ketones. A dipstick is dipped in the urine sample. A color change indicates the presence of ketones.\nThis article describes the ketone urine test that involves sending collected urine to a lab.\nA clean-catch urine sample is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may have to follow a special diet. Your provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that may affect the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nKetone testing is most often done if you have type 1 diabetes and:\n- Your blood sugar is higher than 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)\n- You have nausea or vomiting\n- You have pain in the abdomen\nKetone testing may also be done if:\n- You have an illness such as pneumonia, heart attack, or stroke\n- You have nausea or vomiting that does not go away especially if you take certain medicines\n- You are pregnant\nNormal Results\nA negative test result is normal.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means you have ketones in your urine. The results are typically listed as small, moderate, or large as follows:\n- Small: <20 mg/dL\n- Moderate: 30 to 40 mg/dL\n- Large: >80 mg/dL\nKetones build up when the body needs to break down fats and fatty acids to use as fuel. This is most likely to occur when the body does not get enough sugar or carbohydrates.\nThis may be due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a life-threatening problem that affects people with diabetes. It occurs when the body cannot use sugar (glucose) as a fuel source because there is no insulin or not enough insulin in relation to the amount of glucagon in the blood. Fat is used for fuel instead.\nAn abnormal result may also be due to:\n- Fasting or starvation: such as with anorexia (an eating disorder)\n- High protein or low carbohydrate diet\n- Vomiting over a long period (such as during early pregnancy)\n- Acute or severe illnesses, such as sepsis or burns\n- High fevers\n- The thyroid gland making too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism)\n- Nursing a baby, if the mother does not eat and drink enough\n- Medicines that are sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 inhibitors)\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nKetone bodies - urine; Urine ketones; Ketoacidosis - urine ketones test; Diabetic ketoacidosis - urine ketones test\nReferences\nMurphy M, Srivastava R, Deans K.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000085.htm": "Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.\nWhat is Low Blood Sugar?\nLow blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.\nYou are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:\n- Insulin\n- Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)\nYou are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.\nRecognizing Low Blood Sugar\nKnow how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:\n- Weakness or feeling tired\n- Shaking\n- Sweating\n- Headache\n- Hunger\n- Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious\n- Feeling cranky\n- Trouble thinking clearly\n- Double or blurry vision\n- Fast or pounding heartbeat\nSometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:\nSome people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.\nCheck Your Blood Sugar Often\nTalk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.\nThe most common causes of low blood sugar are:\n- Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time\n- Taking too much insulin or diabetes medicine\n- Taking insulin to correct high blood sugar without eating any food\n- Not eating enough during meals or snacks after you have taken insulin or diabetes medicine\n- Skipping meals (this may mean that your dose of long-acting insulin is too high, so you should talk to your provider)\n- Waiting too long after taking your medicine to eat your meals\n- Exercising a lot or at a time that is unusual for you\n- Not checking your blood sugar or not adjusting your insulin dose before exercising\n- Drinking alcohol\nPreventing Low Blood Sugar\nPreventing low blood sugar is better than having to treat it. Always have a source of fast-acting sugar with you.\n- When you exercise, check your blood sugar levels. Make sure you have snacks with you.\n- Talk to your provider about reducing insulin doses on days that you exercise.\n- Ask your provider if you need a bedtime snack to prevent low blood sugar overnight. Protein snacks may be best.\nDo not drink alcohol without eating food. Women should limit alcohol to 1 drink a day and men should limit alcohol to 2 drinks a day. Family and friends should know how to help. They should know:\n- The symptoms of low blood sugar and how to tell if you have them.\n- How much and what kind of food they should give you.\n- When to call for emergency help.\n- How to inject glucagon, a hormone that increases your blood sugar. Your provider will tell you when to use this medicine.\nIf you have diabetes, always wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. This helps emergency medical workers know you have diabetes.\nWhen Your Blood Sugar Gets Low\nCheck your blood sugar whenever you have symptoms of low blood sugar. If your blood sugar is below 70 mg/dL, treat yourself right away.\n1. Eat something that has about 15 grams (g) of carbohydrates. Examples are:\n- 4 glucose tablets\n- One half cup (4 ounces or 120 mL) of fruit juice or regular, non-diet soda\n- 5 or 6 hard candies\n- 1 tablespoon (tbsp) or 15 mL of sugar, plain or dissolved in water\n- 1 tbsp (15 mL) of honey or syrup\n2. Wait about 15 minutes before eating any more. Be careful not to eat too much. This can cause high blood sugar and weight gain.\n3. Check your blood sugar again.\n4. If you do not feel better in 15 minutes and your blood sugar is still lower than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), eat another snack with 15 g of carbohydrates.\nYou may need to eat a snack with carbohydrates and protein if your blood sugar is in a safer range -- over 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) -- and your next meal is more than an hour away.\nAsk your provider how to manage this situation. If these steps for raising your blood sugar do not work, contact your provider right away.\nTalk to Your Doctor or Nurse\nIf you use insulin and your blood sugar is frequently or consistently low, ask your provider or nurse if you:\n- Are injecting your insulin the right way\n- Need a different type of needle\n- Should change how much insulin you take\n- Should change the kind of insulin you take\nDo not make any changes without talking to your provider or nurse first.\nSometimes hypoglycemia can be due to accidently taking the wrong medicines. Check your medicines with your pharmacist.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nIf signs of low blood sugar do not improve after you have eaten a snack that contains sugar, have someone drive you to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number. Do not drive when your blood sugar is low.\nGet medical help right away for a person with low blood sugar if the person is not alert or cannot be woken up as this is a medical emergency.\nAlternative Names\nHypoglycemia - self care; Low blood glucose - self care\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.

Or, you may need surgery for a medical problem that is unrelated to your diabetes. Your diabetes may increase your risk for problems during or after your surgery, such as:\n- Infection after surgery (especially at the site of the surgery)\n- Healing more slowly\n- Fluid, electrolyte, and kidney problems\n- Heart problems\nBefore Surgery\nWork with your health care provider to come up with the safest surgery plan for you.\nFocus more on controlling your diabetes during the days to weeks before surgery. Stop using tobacco during this time, ideally 6 weeks before surgery.\nYour provider will do a medical exam and talk to you about your health.\n- Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking.\n- If you take metformin, talk to your provider about stopping it. Sometimes, it should be stopped 48 hours before and 48 hours after surgery to decrease the risk of a problem called lactic acidosis.\n- If you take other types of diabetes medicines, follow your provider's instructions about the medicine before surgery. Medicines called SGLT2 inhibitors (\"flozins\") can increase the risk of blood sugar problems related to surgery. Tell your provider if you are taking one of these medicines.\n- If you take insulin, ask your provider what dose you should take the night before or the day of your surgery. Make sure your provider knows whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes as the recommendations to adjust insulin are different.\n- Your provider may have you meet with a dietitian, or give you a specific meal and activity plan to try to make sure your blood sugar is well-controlled for the week prior to your surgery.\n- Some surgeons will cancel or delay surgery if your blood sugar is high when you arrive at the hospital for your surgery.\nSurgery is riskier if you have diabetes complications. So talk to your provider about your diabetes control and any complications you have from diabetes. Tell your provider about any problems you have with your heart, kidneys, or eyes, or if you have loss of feeling in your feet. The provider may run some tests to check the status of those problems.\nDuring Surgery\nYou may do better with surgery and get better faster if your blood sugar is controlled during surgery. So, before surgery, talk to your provider about your blood sugar target level during the days before your operation.\nDuring surgery, insulin may be given by the anesthesiologist. You will meet with this provider before surgery to discuss the plan to control your blood sugar during the operation.\nIf you are taking insulin for your diabetes, ask to schedule your surgery early in the morning to decrease blood sugar problems related to prolonged fasting.\nAfter Surgery\nYou or your nurses should check your blood sugar often. You may have more trouble controlling your blood sugar because you:\n- Have trouble eating\n- Are vomiting\n- Are stressed after surgery\n- Are less active than usual\n- Have pain or discomfort\n- Are given medicines that increase your blood sugar\nExpect that you may take more time to heal because of your diabetes. Be prepared for a longer hospital stay if you are having major surgery. People with diabetes often have to stay in the hospital longer than people without diabetes.\nWatch for signs of infection, such as a fever, or an incision that is red, hot to touch, swollen, more painful, or oozing.\nPrevent bedsores. Move around in bed and get out of bed frequently. If you have less feeling in your toes and fingers, you may not feel if you are getting a bed sore. Make sure you move around.\nAfter you leave the hospital, it is important for you to work with your provider to make sure your blood sugar continues to be well controlled.\nWhen to Call Your Doctor\nContact your provider if:\n- You have any questions about surgery or anesthesia\n- You are not sure what medicines or doses of your medicines you should take or stop taking before surgery\n- You think that you have an infection\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association. 16.

This test is different from the blood sugar checks that people with diabetes do every day.\nYour A1C test result is given in percentages. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been:\n- A normal A1C level is below 5.7%\n- Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%. Having prediabetes is a risk factor for getting type 2 diabetes. People with prediabetes may need retests every year.\n- Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5%\n- If you have diabetes, you should have the A1C test at least twice a year. The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7. It may be different for you. Ask what your goal should be.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/bloodglucose.html": "Basics\nLearn More\nSee, Play and Learn\nResearch\nResources\nFor You\nSummary\nWhat is blood glucose?\nBlood glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.\nWhat is diabetes?\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems (diabetes complications). So if you have diabetes, it's important to keep your blood glucose levels within your target range.\nWhat are blood glucose targets?\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose target is the range you try to reach as much as possible. The typical targets are:\n- Before a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL\n- Two hours after the start of a meal: Less than 180 mg/dL\nYour blood glucose targets may be different, depending on your age, any additional health problems you have, and other factors. Talk with your health care team about the best target range for you.\nWhen and how should I check my blood glucose?\nIf you have diabetes, you'll likely need to check your blood glucose every day to make sure that your blood glucose numbers are in your target range. Some people may need to check their blood glucose several times a day. Ask your health care team how often you need to check it.\nThe most common way to check your blood glucose level at home is with a blood glucose meter. A blood glucose meter measures the amount of glucose in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip.\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another way to check your glucose levels. Most CGM systems use a tiny sensor that is inserted under your skin. The sensor measures your glucose level every few minutes. It can show changes in your glucose level throughout the day and night. A CGM system is especially useful for people who take insulin and have problems with low blood glucose.\nYour provider will also check your blood glucose with a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood glucose level over the past three months. People with diabetes usually have an A1C test at least twice a year. But you may need the test more often if you aren't meeting your diabetes treatment goals.\nWhat happens if my blood glucose level becomes too high?\nHigh blood glucose is called hyperglycemia. Symptoms that your blood glucose levels may be too high include:\n- Feeling thirsty\n- Feeling tired or weak\n- Headaches\n- Urinating (peeing) often\n- Blurred vision\nIf you often have high blood glucose levels or symptoms of high blood glucose, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.\nHigh blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. These conditions include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands.\nWhat happens if my blood glucose level becomes low for me?\nHypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose, happens when your blood glucose level drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you.\nSymptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:\n- Shaking\n- Sweating\n- Nervousness or anxiety\n- Irritability or confusion\n- Dizziness\n- Hunger\nLow blood glucose levels can be common in people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. If you think you may have low blood glucose, check your level, even if you don't have symptoms. Low blood glucose can be dangerous and should be treated as soon as possible.\nAlthough it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics, can also cause it.

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.\nWhat is gestational diabetes?\nSome people already have diabetes before they get pregnant. But others may develop diabetes during pregnancy. This type of diabetes is called gestational diabetes. It usually develops around the 24th week of pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy. Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy, along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nWho is more likely to develop gestational diabetes?\nAnyone who is pregnant could develop gestational diabetes. But you are more likely to develop it if you:\n- Are overweight or have obesity\n- Have a family history of diabetes\n- Had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy\n- Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more\n- Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n- Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander person\nHow do I know if I have gestational diabetes?\nGestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate (pee) more often.\nIf you are pregnant, you will most likely be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But if you have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit. Your health care provider will use one or more blood glucose tests to check for gestational diabetes. You may have the glucose challenge test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or both.\nFor these two tests, you will drink a sugary liquid and wait for an hour before your blood sample is taken. If you have an oral glucose tolerance test, you will also get your blood drawn after 2 and 3 hours.\nHow can diabetes affect my pregnancy?\nHaving diabetes during pregnancy can affect your health. For example:\n- You are more likely to develop preeclampsia, a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure.\n- You are more likely to need a cesarean delivery, because your baby is more likely to be bigger than average.\n- Changes to your hormones and your body during pregnancy can affect your blood glucose levels. If you had diabetes before pregnancy, you may now need to adjust your meal plan, physical activity routine, and/or medicines. If you have any diabetes health problems, they may get worse during pregnancy.\n- Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you have your baby. But you will be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\nHaving diabetes during pregnancy can also affect the health of your developing baby:\n- If you have high blood glucose levels at the beginning of your pregnancy, there is a higher risk of birth defects.\n- Your baby will be at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\n- Your baby is more likely to be born early.\n- Your baby may have breathing problems or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels) right after birth.\n- There is a higher risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.\nHow can I manage diabetes during pregnancy?\nThere are steps you can take to manage your diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy.\nIf you already have diabetes, the best time to control your blood glucose is before you get pregnant. High blood glucose levels can be harmful to your developing baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you are pregnant. See your provider to help you plan for pregnancy. You can talk about how to lower the risk of health problems for you and your developing baby. You can also discuss your diet, physical activity, and which diabetes medicines are safe during pregnancy.\nDuring your pregnancy, you will work with your provider to manage your blood glucose levels. You may be able to manage them with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. If that's not enough, then you will need to take diabetes medicines. It's also important that you:\n- Get regular prenatal checkups\n- Take your prenatal vitamins\n- Don't use harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs\nAfter pregnancy, there are steps you need to take to stay healthy:\n- If you had gestational diabetes, you are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You will be tested for it within 4 to 12 weeks after giving birth. Even if your blood glucose levels have returned to normal, you will need to get them tested every 1 to 3 years.\n- If you already had diabetes before pregnancy, you and your provider will monitor changes to your blood glucose levels. They will tell you if you need to adjust your diabetes management plan.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Blood Glucose Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Glucose in Urine Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Am I at Risk for Gestational Diabetes?

With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.\nWhat health problems can diabetes cause?\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including:\n- Eye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyes.\n- Foot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feet.\n- Gum disease and other dental problems, because a high amount of glucose in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth. The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath. Other types cause tooth decay and cavities.\n- Heart disease and stroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels.\n- Kidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. Many people with diabetes develop high blood pressure. That can also damage your kidneys.\n- Nerve problems (diabetic neuropathy), caused by damage to the nerves and the small blood vessels that nourish your nerves with oxygen and nutrients.\n- Sexual and bladder problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow in the genitals and bladder.\n- Skin conditions, some of which are caused by changes in the small blood vessels and reduced circulation. People with diabetes are also more likely to have infections, including skin infections.\nWhat other problems can people with diabetes have?\nIf you have diabetes, you need to watch out for blood glucose levels that are too high (hyperglycemia) or too low for you (hypoglycemia). These can happen quickly and can become dangerous. Some of the causes include having another illness or infection and certain medicines. They can also happen if you don't get the right amount of diabetes medicines. To try to prevent these problems, make sure to take your diabetes medicines correctly, follow your diabetic diet, and check your blood glucose regularly.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Ketones in Blood (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Ketones in Urine (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Diabetes Care: 10 Ways to Avoid Diabetes Complications (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes, Gum Disease, and Other Dental Problems (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Healthy Weight (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\n- Manage Blood Sugar (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\nLiving With\n- Steps to Prevent or Delay Nerve Damage (American Diabetes Association)\nSpecifics\n- Bone and Joint Problems Associated with Diabetes (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes & Oral Health (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes and DKA (Ketoacidosis) (American Diabetes Association)\n- Diabetes and High Blood Pressure (American Diabetes Association)\n- Diabetes and Skin Complications (American Diabetes Association)\n- Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Stroke (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes, Sexual, and Bladder Problems (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic Coma (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic Hypoglycemia (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic Ketoacidosis (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n- Gastroparesis (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Hyperglycemia in Diabetes (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\nImages\n- Diabetic Dermopathy (VisualDX)\nClinical Trials\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Diabetes Complications (National Institutes of Health)\nJournal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n- Article: Impact of COVID-19 infection on mortality, diabetic complications and haematological parameters...\n- Article: Application and Progression of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing in Diabetes Mellitus and...\n- Article: Cutaneous manifestations of diabetes mellitus: a narrative review.\n- Diabetes Complications -- see more articles\nFind an Expert\n- American Diabetes Association\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n- NIDDK Information Clearinghouses and Health Information Center (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)\nMen\n- Erectile Dysfunction and Diabetes: Take Control Today (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\nWomen\n- Diabetes and Women (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\nPatient Handouts\n- Diabetes - preventing heart attack and stroke (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes: Dental Tips (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research) - PDF\n- Diabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic ketoacidosis (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish\n- Long-term complications of diabetes (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish",

It was called juvenile diabetes. With Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose,or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood.\nNow younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. With Type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well.\nChildren have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are overweight or have obesity, have a family history of diabetes, or are not active. Children who are African American, Hispanic, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American, or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk. To lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in children:\n- Have them maintain a healthy weight\n- Be sure they are physically active\n- Have them eat smaller portions of healthy foods\n- Limit time with the TV, computer, and video\nChildren and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes may be controlled with diet and exercise. If not, patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin.

A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes,your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual. The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.What are the treatments for diabetes?\nTreatments for diabetes can depend on the type. Common treatments include a diabetic meal plan, regular physical activity, and medicines. Some less common treatments are weight loss surgery for either type and an artificial pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.\nWho needs diabetes medicines?\nPeople with type 1 diabetes need to take a diabetes medicine called insulin to control their blood sugar.\nSome people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood sugar with healthy food choices and physical activity. But for others, a diabetic meal plan and physical activity are not enough. They need to take diabetes medicines.\nThe kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes, daily schedule, medicine costs, and any other health conditions that you have. Over time, you may need to take more than one diabetes medicine.\nWhat are the types of medicines for type 1 diabetes?\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin because your body no longer makes it. There are different types of insulin that start to work at different speeds, and the effects of each last a different length of time. Your health care provider will measure your blood glucose to decide on the type of insulin. You may need to use more than one type.\nYou will also need to check your blood sugar at home. Your provider will tell you how often. The results of your blood sugar testing can help you make decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines.\nYou can take insulin several different ways. The most common are with a needle and syringe, an insulin pen, or an insulin pump. If you use a needle and syringe or a pen, you have to take insulin several times during the day, including with meals. An insulin pump gives you small, steady doses throughout the day. Less common ways to take insulin include inhalers, injection ports, and jet injectors.\nIn rare cases, taking insulin alone might not be enough to manage your blood sugar. Then you would need to take another diabetes medicine.\nWhat are the types of medicines for type 2 diabetes?\nThere are several different medicines for type 2 diabetes. Each works in a different way. Many of them are pills. There are also medicines that you inject under your skin, such as insulin.\nOver time, you may need more than one diabetes medicine to manage your blood sugar. You might add another diabetes medicine or switch to a combination medicine. A combination medicine contains more than one type of diabetes medicine in the same pill. Some people with type 2 diabetes take both pills and injections.\nEven if you don't usually take insulin, you may need it at special times, such as during pregnancy or if you are in the hospital.\nWhat else should I know about taking medicines for diabetes?\nEven if you take medicines for diabetes, you still need to eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, take your other medicines, and get regular physical activity. These will help you manage your diabetes.\nIt is important to make sure that you understand your diabetes treatment plan. Talk to your provider about:\n- What your target blood sugar level is\n- What to do if your blood sugar gets too low or too high\n- Whether your diabetes medicines will affect other medicines you take\n- If you will have any side effects from the diabetes medicines\nYou should not change or stop your diabetes medicines on your own.

Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well. The glucose then stays in your blood and not enough goes into your cells.\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors:\n- Being overweight or having obesity\n- Not being physically active\n- Genetics and family history\nType 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.\nWho is at risk for type 2 diabetes?\nYou are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:\n- Are over age 45. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get type 2 diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older people.\n- Have prediabetes, which means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes\n- Had diabetes in pregnancy or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.\n- Have a family history of diabetes\n- Are overweight or have obesity\n- Are Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander\n- Are not physically active\n- Have other conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or depression\n- Have low HDL (good) cholesterol and high triglycerides\n- Have acanthosis nigricans - dark, thick, and velvety skin around your neck or armpits\nWhat are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes?\nMany people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all. If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include:\n- Increased thirst and urination\n- Increased hunger\n- Feeling tired\n- Blurred vision\n- Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands\n- Sores that do not heal\n- Unexplained weight loss\nHow is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?\nYour health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include:\n- A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months\n- Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.\n- Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.\nWhat are the treatments for type 2 diabetes?\nTreatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine:\n- A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any.\n- Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes.\n- You will need to check your blood sugar regularly. Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to do it.\n- It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly.\nCan type 2 diabetes be prevented?\nYou can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. If you have a condition which raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, managing that condition may lower your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- A1C: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests and Diagnosis (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Insulin in Blood (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Ketones in Blood (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Ketones in Urine (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Find a Lifestyle Change Program (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n- How to Prevent Diabetes: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nTreatments and Therapies\n- Diabetes and Dietary Supplements: What You Need to Know (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Medicines: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Women and Diabetes -- Diabetes Medicines (Food and Drug Administration)\nLiving With\n- Changing Your Habits for Better Health (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes and Mental Health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic Diet: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Healthy Weight (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\n- How to Stay Healthy With Type 2 Diabetes (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish\n- Managing Diabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Your Diabetes Care Team (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\nRelated Issues\n- 5 Things To Know About Type 2 Diabetes and Dietary Supplements (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health)\n- Acanthosis Nigricans (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Health Consequences of Early Exposure to Sugar\n- Healthy Living with Diabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- National Diabetes Prevention Program (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n- Prediabetes:MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Speak Up -- Diabetes: Five Ways to Be Active in Your Care at the Hospital (Joint Commission) - PDF\n- Symptoms and Causes of Diabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\nSpecifics\n- Hyperinsulinemia: Is it diabetes?

Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\nPrediabetes means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\nHow do the foods I eat affect my blood glucose levels?\nThe glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates, or \"carbs.\" Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be.\nWhether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood glucose at a level that is healthy for you. When you control your blood glucose, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes, such as vision loss and heart problems.\nAnd if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood glucose levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on.\nWhat's the best diet for diabetes?\nThere isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator who can help design the best eating plan for you. The plan will consider:\n- Any medicines that you take\n- Your weight\n- Any other health conditions you have\n- Your lifestyle and tastes\n- Your goals\nAll eating plans for diabetes have a few things in common, including eating the right foods in the right amounts at the right times.\nWhat foods should I eat if I have diabetes?\nEating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups:\n- Fruits and vegetables\n- Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats\n- Proteins, such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu\n- Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese\nWhat foods should I limit to control my blood glucose?\nTo keep your blood glucose under control, you may need to cut back on certain foods and drinks. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you will need to have them less often or in smaller amounts.\n- High-carb foods and drinks, such as:\n- Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar\n- Drinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks\n- White rice, tortillas, breads and pasta - especially those made with white flour\n- Starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas\n- Fried foods and other foods high in saturated trans fats.\n- Foods high in sodium (salt).\n- Alcohol. If you do drink, you should drink moderately. This means no more than one standard drink a day if you're a woman or two standard drinks a day if you're a man.\nWhat else do I need to know about diabetic diets?\nIf you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, so that you get the right amount of carbs in each meal or snack. You'll learn how to count carbs and measure your food.\nEating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid blood glucose levels that are too high or too low for you. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful.\nYour eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out.\nEating healthy to control your blood glucose does take some effort. But the reward is a chance to live your healthiest life with diabetes.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nLiving With\n- Carb Counting (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n- Diabetes and Your Diet (American Heart Association)\n- What is the Diabetes Plate Method?

Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy.

Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\nWhat eye problems can diabetes cause?\nOver time, high blood glucose may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetic eye problems include:\n- Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye.\n- Diabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (the part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy.\n- Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye.\n- Cataract, which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes.\nWho is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems?\nAnyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you have diabetes and:\n- Have had diabetes for a long time\n- Don't have good control over your high blood glucose or high blood pressure\n- Are pregnant\n- Have high blood cholesterol\n- Smoke tobacco\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?\nIn the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy.\nYou should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could be signs of an emergency. Call your eye care professional right away if you notice any of these symptoms:\n- Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters)\n- Flashes of light\n- A dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain\n- Vision loss\n- Eye pain or redness\nTalk with your eye care professional if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go:\n- Spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision\n- Blurry or wavy vision\n- Vision that changes a lot\n- Trouble seeing colors\nHow are diabetic eye problems diagnosed?\nEye care professionals do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your eye care professional can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. They will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes.\nWhat are the treatments for diabetic eye problems?\nTreatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include:\n- Lasers to stop blood vessels from leaking\n- Injections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing\n- Surgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens\n- Eye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye\nBut these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams. It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in a healthy range.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nSymptoms\n- Eye Symptoms (American Academy of Ophthalmology) Also in Spanish\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Eye Exam and Vision Testing Basics (American Academy of Ophthalmology) Also in Spanish\n- What Are Dilating Eye Drops?

Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual. The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\nHow does diabetes cause foot problems?\nFoot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy, can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet.\nIf you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister, or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet.\nHaving an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene. That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation. This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg. It may prevent a bad infection from spreading and could save your life.\nBut there's a lot you can do to prevent a foot wound from becoming a major health problem.\nHow can I protect my feet if I have diabetes?\nThe best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy.\nGood foot care for people with diabetes includes:\n- Checking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too.\n- Washing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes.\n- Asking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers.\n- Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you.\n- Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble could rub your skin raw.\n- Protecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace.\n- Keeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking.\n- Getting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your health care provider look at your feet.\nWhen should I see my health care provider about diabetic foot problems?\nSerious foot problems can develop quickly. See your health care provider right away if you notice:\n- A cut, blister, or bruise on your feet that doesn't start to heal in a few days\n- Red, warm, or painful skin on your feet\n- A callus with dried blood inside\n- A foot infection that becomes black and smells bad that could be gangrene\nRemember, controlling your blood sugar and caring for your feet every day are the best steps you can take to prevent serious diabetic foot problems.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nLearn More\n- Focus on Your Feet!

Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\nWhat is diabetic heart disease?\nDiabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don't have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age.\nOver time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including:\n- Coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood.\n- Heart failure. With this condition, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body.\n- Cardiomyopathy. This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff.\nWho is more likely to develop diabetic heart disease?\nDiabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease. It also makes you more likely to develop other conditions that raise your risk even more, including:\n- High blood pressure\n- High blood levels of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol\n- High triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) with low blood levels of HDL \"good\" cholesterol\nYour risk for heart disease is also higher if you\n- Are male\n- Smoke\n- Have obesity\n- Have too much belly fat around your waist, even though you're at a healthy weight:\n- For men, that's a waist more than 40 inches\n- For women, that's a waist more than 35 inches\n- Have a family history of heart disease\n- Have chronic kidney disease\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetic heart disease?\nIn the early stages, heart disease usually doesn't have any symptoms. But if your heart disease worsens, you can have symptoms. Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. They might include:\n- Shortness of breath\n- Fatigue\n- Dizziness or fainting\n- Arrhythmia (problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n- Swollen feet and ankles\n- Chest pain\nIt's important to know that people with diabetes may not feel chest pain. That's because diabetes can damage the nerves in your heart. If you have any symptoms that could be heart disease, talk with your health care provider.\nHow is diabetic heart disease diagnosed?\nTo find out if you have diabetic heart disease, your provider will:\n- Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have\n- Ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had heart disease\n- Do a physical exam\n- Likely run some tests to help understand your personal risk for heart disease, including:\n- Blood tests to check your cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar levels\n- A blood-pressure check\n- Heart tests, if needed\nDepending on your risk level, your provider may send you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for care. If you do have heart disease, treatment will depend on the type of heart disease you have.\nHow can I prevent diabetic heart disease?\nYou may be able to prevent heart disease or keep it from getting worse by working with your provider to:\n- Control your blood sugar levels\n- Manage other conditions you may have that can raise your risk for heart disease\n- Take any medicines your provider prescribed\n- Make heart-healthy habits part of your daily life\n- Follow a healthy eating plan for diabetes\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Heart Health Tests for People with Diabetes (American Heart Association)\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Cholesterol and Diabetes (American Heart Association)\nTreatments and Therapies\n- Chelation for Coronary Heart Disease: What You Need To Know (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health)\nLiving With\n- Diabetes and Your Diet (American Heart Association)\nClinical Trials\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Diabetic Cardiomyopathies (National Institutes of Health)\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Diabetic Heart Disease (National Institutes of Health)\nJournal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n- Article: Identification and validation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related diagnostic biomarkers for type...\n- Article: Effects of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia on cardiac function in people with type...\n- Article: Mechanistic insight into the role of cardiac-enriched microRNAs in diabetic heart...\n- Diabetic Heart Disease -- see more articles\nFind an Expert\n- American Diabetes Association\n- American Heart Association\n- National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n- NIDDK Information Clearinghouses and Health Information Center (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)",

If they are damaged, waste and fluids build up in your blood instead of leaving your body.\nKidney damage from diabetes is called diabetic nephropathy. It begins long before you have symptoms. People with diabetes should get regular screenings for kidney disease. Tests include a urine test to detect protein in your urine and a blood test to show how well your kidneys are working.\nIf the damage continues, your kidneys could fail. In fact, diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure in the United States. People with kidney failure need either dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nYou can slow down kidney damage or keep it from getting worse.

It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.\nFor people with diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.\nWhat is hyperglycemia?\nHyperglycemia means high blood glucose. It most often affects people who have diabetes. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.\nWhat causes hyperglycemia?\nA key part of managing diabetes is controlling your blood glucose levels. To do this, you need to follow a diabetes meal plan and get regular physical activity. You might also need to take diabetes medicines. You have to balance all of these to keep your blood glucose at the right levels. But if you eat too much food or the wrong foods, don't take your medicines correctly, or don't get physical activity, you can get hyperglycemia. It can also happen if you are stressed or sick.\nLess commonly, people who don't have diabetes can also get hyperglycemia. It can be caused by conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. They include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands, certain medicines, and severe illnesses.\nWhat are the symptoms of hyperglycemia?\nThe symptoms of hyperglycemia include:\n- Feeling thirsty\n- Feeling tired or weak\n- Headaches\n- Urinating (peeing) often\n- Blurred vision\nIf you are diabetic and you often have high blood glucose levels or the symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.\nIf you don't have diabetes and you are having these symptoms, see your provider to find out the cause and how to treat it.\nWhat other problems can hyperglycemia cause?\nIf hyperglycemia is not treated, it can cause other problems. In people with diabetes, long-term hyperglycemia can lead to serious health problems (diabetes complications).\nIf your blood glucose levels get very high, you can develop diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). It happens when your body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood glucose into your cells for use as energy. Instead, your liver breaks down fat for fuel. This process produces acids called ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body. This can be life-threatening.\nThe symptoms of DKA may include:\n- Trouble breathing\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Pain in your abdomen (belly)\n- Confusion\n- Feeling very tired or sleepy\nIf you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms. If the test shows that your ketones are moderate or high, or if you don't have a ketones test, contact your health care provider right away or get emergency medical help.\nHow is hyperglycemia diagnosed?\nIf you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too high. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.\nThere are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too high.\nWhat are the treatments for hyperglycemia?\nIf you have diabetes and often have high blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.\nIf you have severe hyperglycemia and are having symptoms of DKA, you will need treatment at the hospital. The treatment often includes I.V. (intravenous) fluids and insulin.\nCan hyperglycemia be prevented?\nIf you have diabetes, managing your diabetes can help prevent hyperglycemia. To manage your diabetes, it's important to:\n- Follow your diabetes meal plan\n- Get regular physical activity\n- If you need diabetes medicines, take them correctly\n- Regularly check your blood glucose level\n- Get regular checkups with your health care team\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- A1C: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Blood Glucose Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nRelated Issues\n- Diabetes and DKA (Ketoacidosis) (American Diabetes Association)\n- Diabetic Ketoacidosis (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\nClinical Trials\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Hyperglycemia (National Institutes of Health)\nJournal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n- Article: Effects of Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.)

When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.\nFor people with diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.\nWhat is hypoglycemia?\nHypoglycemia means low glucose. It happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you:\n- For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is too low for you.\n- For people who don't have diabetes, hypoglycemia is typically a blood glucose level lower than 55 mg/dL.\nWhat causes hypoglycemia?\nHypoglycemia is common in people who have diabetes type 1 or who have diabetes type 2 and take insulin or other diabetes medicines. It can happen:\n- As a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. These medicines can lower your blood glucose level.\n- If you don't eat or drink enough carbohydrates (carbs). Carbs are the main source of glucose for your body.\n- If you get a lot more physical activity than usual.\n- If you drink too much alcohol without enough food.\n- When you are sick and can't eat enough food or keep food down.\nAlthough it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). It can also happen in people who have had certain types of weight loss surgery. Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics, can also cause it. See your health care provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.\nWhat are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?\nThe symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:\n- Shaking\n- Sweating\n- Nervousness or anxiety\n- Irritability or confusion\n- Dizziness\n- Hunger\nHow is hypoglycemia diagnosed?\nIf you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too low. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.\nThere are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too low.\nIf you don't have diabetes and you have hypoglycemia, your provider will likely order other tests to try to figure out the cause.\nWhat are the treatments for hypoglycemia?\nIf you have mild or moderate hypoglycemia, eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. But severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or even death. Severe hypoglycemia can be treated with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It can be given as nasal spray or injection. If you have diabetes, your provider can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency.\nIf you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.\nIf you don't have diabetes and you keep having low blood glucose, the treatment will depend on what is causing it to happen.\nCan hypoglycemia be prevented?\nIf you have diabetes and you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, you can help prevent hypoglycemia if you:\n- Follow your diabetes meal plan. Eat and drink enough carbs to keep your blood glucose in your target range. Also carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you in case your blood glucose gets too low.\n- Be safe during physical activity. Check your blood glucose before and afterwards. You may need to eat a snack before your physical activity.\n- If you take diabetes medicines, make sure to take them correctly.\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Blood Glucose Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- C-Peptide Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Glucagon Blood Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Insulin in Blood (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nSpecifics\n- Diabetic Hypoglycemia (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Hyperinsulinemia: Is it diabetes?

One of these is beta cells, which make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Islet cell transplantation transfers cells from an organ donor into the body of another person. It is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes.\nIn type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin. A person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Transplanted islet cells, however, can take over the work of the destroyed cells. The beta cells in these islets will begin to make and release insulin. Researchers hope islet transplantation will help people with type 1 diabetes live without daily insulin injections.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nLearn More\n- Pancreatic Islet Transplantation (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- What Is Islet Transplantation?

It can allow them to give up insulin shots. An experimental procedure called islet cell transplantation transplants only the parts of the pancreas that make insulin.\nPeople who have transplants must take drugs to keep their body from rejecting the new pancreas for the rest of their lives.

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time.\nIf you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. But if you make some lifestyle changes now, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.\nWhat causes prediabetes?\nPrediabetes usually happens when your body has a problem with insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. A problem with insulin could be:\n- Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use its insulin properly. It makes it hard for your cells to get glucose from your blood. This can cause your blood sugar levels to rise.\n- Your body can't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar levels at a healthy level\nResearchers think that being overweight and not getting regular physical activity are major factors in causing prediabetes.\nWho is at risk for prediabetes?\nAbout 1 out of every 3 adults has prediabetes. It is more common in people who:\n- Are overweight or have obesity\n- Are age 45 or older\n- Have a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes\n- Are African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American\n- Are not physically active\n- Have health conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol\n- Have had gestational diabetes (diabetes in pregnancy)\n- Have a history of heart disease or stroke\n- Have metabolic syndrome\n- Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nWhat are the symptoms of prediabetes?\nMost people don't know they have prediabetes because usually there are no symptoms.\nSome people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpit or on the back and sides of the neck. They may also have many small skin growths in those same areas.\nHow is prediabetes diagnosed?\nThere are a few different blood tests that can diagnose prediabetes. The most common ones are:\n- Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your blood sugar at a single point in time. You need to fast (not eat or drink) for at least 8 hours before the test. The results of the test are given in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter):\n- A normal level is 99 or below\n- Prediabetes is 100 to 125\n- Type 2 diabetes is 126 and above\n- A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar over the past 3 months. The results of an A1C test are given as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been.\n- A normal level is below 5.7%\n- Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%\n- Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5%\nIf I have prediabetes, will I get diabetes?\nIf you have prediabetes, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes:\n- Losing weight, if you are overweight\n- Getting regular physical activity\n- Following a healthy, reduced-calorie eating plan\nIn some cases, your health care provider may also recommend taking diabetes medicines.\nCan prediabetes be prevented?\nIf you are at risk for prediabetes, those same lifestyle changes (losing weight, regular physical activity, and a healthy eating plan) may prevent you from getting it.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- A1C: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Blood Glucose and A1C: Diagnosis (American Diabetes Association)\n- Blood Glucose Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests and Diagnosis (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Diabetes Risk Factors (American Heart Association)\n- Surprising Truth about Prediabetes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\nLiving With\n- How to Prevent Diabetes: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nRelated Issues\n- Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Stroke (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Insulin Resistance and Prediabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\nClinical Trials\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Insulin Resistance (National Institutes of Health)\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Prediabetic State (National Institutes of Health)\nJournal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n- Article: Effectiveness of a low-intensity nurse-led lifestyle intervention on glycaemic control in...\n- Article: Impact of Exercise Manual Program on Biochemical Markers in Sedentary Prediabetic...\n- Article: Efficacy and safety of red ginseng extract powder (KGC05pg) in achieving...\n- Prediabetes -- see more articles\nFind an Expert\n- American Diabetes Association\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n- NIDDK Information Clearinghouses and Health Information Center (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)\nChildren\n- Prediabetes in Children -- Five Things Parents Need to Know (Merck & Co., Inc.)

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diet-nutrition/changing-habits-better-health": "Changing Your Habits for Better Health\nOn this page:\n- What stage of change are you in?\n- Contemplation: Are you thinking of making changes?\n- Preparation: Have you made up your mind?\n- Action: Have you started to make changes?\n- Maintenance: Have you created a new routine?\n- Clinical Trials\nAre you thinking about being more active? Have you been trying to cut back on less healthy foods? Are you starting to eat better and move more but having a hard time sticking with these changes?\nOld habits die hard. Changing your habits is a process that involves several stages. Sometimes it takes a while before changes become new habits. And, you may face roadblocks along the way.\nAdopting new, healthier habits may protect you from serious health problems like obesity and diabetes. New habits, like healthy eating and regular physical activity, may also help you manage your weight and have more energy. After a while, if you stick with these changes, they may become part of your daily routine.\nThe information below outlines four stages you may go through when changing your health habits or behavior. You will also find tips to help you improve your eating, physical activity habits, and overall health. The four stages of changing a health behavior are\n- contemplation\n- preparation\n- action\n- maintenance\nWhat stage of change are you in?\nContemplation: \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d\nIn this first stage, you are thinking about change and becoming motivated to get started.\nYou might be in this stage if you\n- have been considering change but are not quite ready to start\n- believe that your health, energy level, or overall well-being will improve if you develop new habits\n- are not sure how you will overcome the roadblocks that may keep you from starting to change\nPreparation: \u201cI have made up my mind to take action.\u201d\nIn this next stage, you are making plans and thinking of specific ideas that will work for you.\nYou might be in this stage if you\n- have decided that you are going to change and are ready to take action\n- have set some specific goals that you would like to meet\n- are getting ready to put your plan into action\nAction: \u201cI have started to make changes.\u201d\nIn this third stage, you are acting on your plan and making the changes you set out to achieve.\nYou might be in this stage if you\n- have been making eating, physical activity, and other behavior changes in the last 6 months or so\n- are adjusting to how it feels to eat healthier, be more active, and make other changes such as getting more sleep or reducing screen time\n- have been trying to overcome things that sometimes block your success\nMaintenance: \u201cI have a new routine.\u201d\nIn this final stage, you have become used to your changes and have kept them up for more than 6 months.\nYou might be in this stage if\n- your changes have become a normal part of your routine\n- you have found creative ways to stick with your routine\n- you have had slip-ups and setbacks but have been able to get past them and make progress\nDid you find your stage of change? Read on for ideas about what you can do next.\nContemplation: Are you thinking of making changes?\nMaking the leap from thinking about change to taking action can be hard and may take time. Asking yourself about the pros (benefits) and cons (things that get in the way) of changing your habits may be helpful. How would life be better if you made some changes?\nThink about how the benefits of healthy eating or regular physical activity might relate to your overall health. For example, suppose your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is a bit high and you have a parent, brother, or sister who has type 2 diabetes. This means you also may develop type 2 diabetes. You may find that it is easier to be physically active and eat healthy knowing that it may help control blood glucose and protect you from a serious disease.\nYou may learn more about the benefits of changing your eating and physical activity habits from a health care professional. This knowledge may help you take action.\nLook at the lists of pros and cons below. Find the items you believe are true for you. Think about factors that are important to you.\nHealthy Eating\n| Pros | Cons |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nPhysical Activity\n| Pros | Cons |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nPreparation: Have you made up your mind?\nIf you are in the preparation stage, you are about to take action. To get started, look at your list of pros and cons. How can you make a plan and act on it?\nThe chart below lists common roadblocks you may face and possible solutions to overcome roadblocks as you begin to change your habits. Think about these things as you make your plan.\n| Roadblock | Solution |\n|---|---|\n| I don\u2019t have time. | Make your new healthy habit a priority. Fit in physical activity whenever and wherever you can. Try taking the stairs or getting off the bus a stop early if it is safe to do so. Set aside one grocery shopping day a week, and make healthy meals that you can freeze and eat later when you don\u2019t have time to cook. |\n| Healthy habits cost too much. | You can walk around the mall, a school track, or a local park for free. Eat healthy on a budget by buying in bulk and when items are on sale, and by choosing frozen or canned fruits and vegetables. |\n| I can\u2019t make this change alone. | Recruit others to be active with you, which will help you stay motivated and safe. Consider signing up for a fun fitness class like salsa dancing. Get your family or coworkers on the healthy eating bandwagon. Plan healthy meals together with your family, or start a healthy potluck once a week at work. |\n| I don\u2019t like physical activity. | Forget the old notion that being physically active means lifting weights in a gym. You can be active in many ways, including dancing, walking, or gardening. Make your own list of options that appeal to you. Explore options you never thought about, and stick with what you enjoy. |\n| I don\u2019t like healthy foods. | Try making your old favorite recipes in healthier new ways. For example, you can trim fat from meats and reduce the amount of butter, sugar, and salt you cook with. Use low-fat cheeses or milk rather than whole-milk foods. Add a cup or two of broccoli, carrots, or spinach to casseroles or pasta. |\nOnce you have made up your mind to change your habits, make a plan and set goals for taking action. Here are some ideas for making your plan:\n- learn more about healthy eating and food portions\n- learn more about being physically active\n- make lists of\n- healthy foods that you like or may need to eat more of\u2014or more often\n- foods you love that you may need to eat less often\n- things you could do to be more physically active\n- fun activities you like and could do more often, such as dancing\nAfter making your plan, start setting goals for putting your plan into action. Start with small changes. For example, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk for 10 minutes, three times a week.\u201d What is the one step you can take right away?\nAction: Have you started to make changes?\nYou are making real changes to your lifestyle, which is fantastic! To stick with your new habits\n- review your plan\n- look at the goals you set and how well you are meeting them\n- overcome roadblocks by planning ahead for setbacks\n- reward yourself for your hard work\nTrack your progress\n- Tracking your progress helps you spot your strengths, find areas where you can improve, and stay on course. Record not only what you did, but how you felt while doing it\u2014your feelings can play a role in making your new habits stick.\n- Recording your progress may help you stay focused and catch setbacks in meeting your goals. Remember that a setback does not mean you have failed. All of us experience setbacks. The key is to get back on track as soon as you can.\n- You can track your progress with online tools such as the NIH Body Weight Planner. The NIH Body Weight Planner lets you tailor your calorie and physical activity plans to reach your personal goals within a specific time period.\nOvercome roadblocks\n- Remind yourself why you want to be healthier. Perhaps you want the energy to play with your nieces and nephews or to be able to carry your own grocery bags. Recall your reasons for making changes when slip-ups occur. Decide to take the first step to get back on track.\n- Problem-solve to \u201coutsmart\u201d roadblocks. For example, plan to walk indoors, such as at a mall, on days when bad weather keeps you from walking outside.\n- Ask a friend or family member for help when you need it, and always try to plan ahead. For example, if you know that you will not have time to be physically active after work, go walking with a coworker at lunch or start your day with an exercise video.\nReward yourself\n- After reaching a goal or milestone, allow for a nonfood reward such as new workout gear or a new workout device. Also consider posting a message on social media to share your success with friends and family.\n- Choose rewards carefully. Although you should be proud of your progress, keep in mind that a high-calorie treat or a day off from your activity routine are not the best rewards to keep you healthy.\n- Pat yourself on the back. When negative thoughts creep in, remind yourself how much good you are doing for your health by moving more and eating healthier.\nMaintenance: Have you created a new routine?\nMake your future a healthy one. Remember that eating healthy, getting regular physical activity, and other healthy habits are lifelong behaviors, not one-time events. Always keep an eye on your efforts and seek ways to deal with the planned and unplanned changes in life.\nNow that healthy eating and regular physical activity are part of your routine, keep things interesting, avoid slip-ups, and find ways to cope with what life throws at you.\nAdd variety and stay motivated\n- Mix up your routine with new physical activities and goals, physical activity buddies, foods, recipes, and rewards.\nDeal with unexpected setbacks\n- Plan ahead to avoid setbacks. For example, find other ways to be active in case of bad weather, injury, or other issues that arise. Think of ways to eat healthy when traveling or dining out, like packing healthy snacks while on the road or sharing an entr\u00e9e with a friend in a restaurant.\n- If you do have a setback, don\u2019t give up. Setbacks happen to everyone. Regroup and focus on meeting your goals again as soon as you can.\nChallenge yourself!\n- Revisit your goals and think of ways to expand them. For example, if you are comfortable walking 5 days a week, consider adding strength training twice a week. If you have limited your saturated fat intake by eating less fried foods, try cutting back on added sugars, too. Small changes can lead to healthy habits worth keeping.\nClinical Trials\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.\nWhat are clinical trials, and are they right for you?\nClinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances.

DKA is caused by an overload of ketones present in your blood.\nWhen your cells don't get the glucose they need for energy, your body begins to burn fat for energy, which produces ketones. Ketones are chemicals that the body creates when it breaks down fat to use for energy. The body does this when it doesn\u2019t have enough insulin to use glucose, the body\u2019s normal source of energy. When ketones build up in the blood, they make it more acidic. They are a warning sign that your diabetes is out of control or that you are getting sick.\nHigh levels of ketones can poison the body. When levels get too high, you can develop DKA. DKA may happen to anyone with diabetes, though it is rare in people with type 2.\nTreatment for DKA usually takes place in the hospital. But you can help prevent it by learning the warning signs and checking your urine and blood regularly.",
            "https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/mental-health.html": "Key points\n- Untreated mental health issues can make diabetes worse.\n- Problems with diabetes can make mental health issues worse.\n- Fortunately, if one gets better, the other tends to get better too.\nWhy it's important\nIs mental health pretty low on your list of priorities for managing diabetes? This may change your mind.\nMental health has an impact on so many parts of daily life. It affects how you think and feel, handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. You can see how a mental health problem could make it harder to stick to your diabetes care plan.\nThe mind-body connection\nThoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can affect how healthy your body is. Untreated mental health issues can make diabetes worse. Likewise, problems with diabetes can make mental health issues worse. But fortunately if one gets better, the other tends to get better too.\nDepression: more than just a bad mood\nDepression is a medical illness that causes feelings of sadness. It also can cause a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. It can get in the way of how well you function at work and home. That includes taking care of your diabetes. When you aren't able to manage your diabetes well, your risk goes up for diabetes-related health problems.\nPeople with diabetes are 2 to 3 times more likely to have depression than people without diabetes. Only 25% to 50% of people with diabetes who have depression get diagnosed and treated. But treatment\u2014therapy, medicine, or both\u2014is usually very effective. And without treatment, depression often gets worse, not better.\nSymptoms of depression can be mild to severe, and include:\n- Feeling sad or empty\n- Losing interest in favorite activities\n- Overeating or not wanting to eat at all\n- Not being able to sleep or sleeping too much\n- Having trouble concentrating or making decisions\n- Feeling very tired\n- Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty\n- Having aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems\n- Having thoughts of suicide or death\nIf you think you might have depression, get in touch with your doctor right away for help getting treatment. The earlier depression is treated, the better for you, your quality of life, and your diabetes.\nNeed mental health help now?\nStress and anxiety\nStress is part of life, from traffic jams to family demands to everyday diabetes care. You can feel stress as an emotion, such as fear or anger. It can also be a physical reaction like sweating or a racing heart.\nIf you're stressed, you may not take care of yourself as well as usual. Your blood sugar levels can be affected too. Stress hormones make blood sugar rise or fall unpredictably. Stress from being sick or injured can make your blood sugar go up. Being stressed for a long time can lead to other health problems or make them worse.\nAnxiety\u2014feelings of worry, fear, or being on edge\u2014is how your mind and body react to stress. People with diabetes are 20% more likely than those without diabetes to have anxiety. Managing a long-term condition like diabetes is a major source of anxiety for some.\nStudies show that therapy for anxiety usually works better than medicine, but sometimes both together works best. You can also help lower your stress and anxiety by:\nGetting active. Even a quick walk can be calming, and the effect can last for hours.\nDoing some relaxation exercises, like meditation or yoga.\nCalling or texting a friend who understands you (not someone who is causing you stress!).\nGrabbing some \"you\" time. Take a break from whatever you're doing. Go outside, read something fun\u2014whatever helps you recharge.\nTaking care of yourself. Limit alcohol and caffeine, eat healthy food, and get enough sleep.\nAnxiety can feel like low blood sugar and vice versa. It may be hard for you to recognize which it is and treat it effectively. If you're feeling anxious, try checking your blood sugar and treat it if it's low.\nThere will always be some stress in life. But if you feel overwhelmed, talking to a mental health counselor can help. Ask your doctor for a referral.\nDiabetes distress\nYou may sometimes feel discouraged, worried, frustrated, or tired of dealing with daily diabetes care. Maybe you've been trying hard but not seeing results. Or you've developed a health problem related to diabetes in spite of your best efforts.\nThose overwhelming feelings, known as diabetes distress, may cause you to stop taking care of yourself. You may slip into unhealthy habits, stop checking your blood sugar, even skip doctor's appointments.\nIt happens to many\u2014if not most\u2014people with diabetes, often after years of good management.\nDid you know?\nDiabetes distress can look like depression or anxiety, but it can't be treated effectively with medicine. Instead, these approaches have been shown to help:\n- Make sure you're seeing an endocrinologist for your diabetes care. These specialists likely have a deeper understanding of diabetes challenges than your regular doctor.\n- Ask your doctor to refer you to a mental health counselor who specializes in chronic health conditions.\n- Get some one-on-one time with a diabetes educator so you can problem-solve together.\n- Focus on one or two small diabetes management goals instead of thinking you have to work on everything all at once.\nTalk to your health care team\nYour health care team knows diabetes is challenging but may not understand how challenging. And you may not be used to talking about feeling sad or down. But if you're concerned about your mental health, let your doctor know right away. You're not alone\u2014help is available!",
            "https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/healthy-weight.html": "What to know\n- Two ways to find out if you're at a healthy weight: body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.\n- Losing weight doesn't have to mean losing a lot of weight.\n- Willpower isn't the long-term answer for weight loss\u2014read on to find out what is.\nWhat is a healthy weight?\nIs it the weight you think you should be? The same as you weighed 20 years ago? Ten pounds less than your sister-in-law? We can't provide an exact number for you. But we can give you some pointers on how to get to a healthy weight and stay there.\nTwo ways to get an idea if your weight is healthy or not: body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.\nBMI\nBMI measures your height compared to your weight. For example, a person who is 5'7\" and weighs 170 pounds has a BMI of 26.6, which is in the overweight range.\nBMI ranges\nUnderweight: less than 18.5\nNormal: 18.5\u201324.9\nOverweight: 25\u201329.9\nObesity: 30 or greater\nBut experts note that BMI doesn't measure belly fat, and that's important. Too much belly fat can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.\nWaist circumference\nWaist circumference (waist size) takes belly fat into account. It helps predict your risk of health problems from being overweight. Women whose waist measures more than 35 inches are at higher risk. So are men whose waist measures more than 40 inches. Losing weight can reduce belly fat and lower that risk!\nTo measure your waist correctly, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hip bones. Breathe in, and then measure your waist just after you breathe out.\nGetting started\nLosing weight doesn't have to mean losing a lot of weight. Taking off just 5% to 10% can improve your health and well-being. That's 10 to 20 pounds for a 200-pound person.\nIf you have diabetes, you may find your blood sugar levels are easier to manage after you lose weight. You may also need less diabetes medicine. Many people who lose weight notice that they have more energy and sleep better too.\nA healthy weight goal is one thing; dropping the pounds is quite another. If there were an easy way to lose weight and keep it off, everyone would be doing it. We've all known someone who follows a popular diet plan and loses weight fast. But then they gain it all back (and then some). After trying and failing over and over, it's easy to see why people give up.\nSuccess!\nFood for life\nInstead, create an eating plan that you can follow for life. It just needs two key ingredients:\n- It's based on healthy food.\n- You can keep doing it long term.\nWith that in mind, you may need to try different things to figure out what works for you. Some people cut back on sugar and eat more protein to stay fuller longer. Others focus on filling up with extra fruits and vegetables, which leaves less room for unhealthy food. Still others limit variety for most meals and stick with choices that they know are healthy and filling.\nThe details will depend on what you like and what fits in best with your life. If you need ideas and support, talk to a registered dietitian or diabetes educator. Your doctor can give you a referral.\nPhysical activity\nPhysical activity can make you feel better, function better, and sleep better. You're not likely to lose a lot of weight with physical activity alone. But combining it with your diet strategy can improve weight loss. Here are the basic guidelines:\nEvery week\nDo at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking. Or do 75 minutes of vigorous activity, such as jogging. You can also do a combination of the two.\nTwo or more days a week\nDo strength-training activities that involve all major muscle groups, such as lifting weights or using a resistance band.\nIf you have diabetes, physical activity can help you manage the condition along with your weight. Being active makes you more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that helps cells in your body use blood sugar for energy). Your body won't need to make as much insulin or you won't need to take as much. Lower insulin levels can help prevent fat storage and weight gain.\nWillpower isn't enough\nDon't get us wrong: willpower is great. It just isn't enough. You can't count on it to reach and maintain the healthier weight you want.\nBut don't worry; there are other ways. Control your environment so temptation is out of the picture and healthy habits are in. Some ideas:\n- Don't bring home food you don't want to eat. Make home a safe zone!\n- Avoid buffet-style restaurants.\n- Don't let yourself get too hungry.\n- Cook your own food so you can control the calories.\n- Lay out your workout clothes before you go to sleep.\n- Keep the dog's leash and your walking shoes by the door.\nSleep helps\nToo little sleep makes dieting much harder because it increases your hunger and appetite. And what do you want more of? High-calorie, high-carb foods.\nToo little sleep also triggers stress hormones, which tell your body to hang onto fat. Outsmart this problem by being physically active, which can help you fall asleep faster and sleep better.\nA relaxing nighttime routine can also help you get your zzz's. These tips are tried and true:\n- No screens an hour before bedtime.\n- Avoid heavy meals and alcohol before bedtime.\n- Keep your bedroom dark and cool.\nWrite it when you bite it\nWriting down what you eat is the single best predictor of weight loss success. But most people don't do it because they think it will be too time-consuming. Guess how long it takes (yes, studies have been done)? Less than 15 minutes a day on average.\nYou don't need to add lots of detail, but aim for at least 3 entries each day. Do it consistently day after day for the best results.\nFind your \"why\"\nPeople who keep the weight off tend to be motivated by more than just being thinner. For some, it might be a health scare. Others want more energy to play with their grandkids. Focus on a goal that's meaningful to you, and you'll be more likely to keep the pounds off too.\nMore tips\nHigher protein, lower carbs\nEat higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate meals to control hunger and appetite. For people with diabetes who take insulin, eating fewer carbs can lower how much insulin they need. Using less insulin can help prevent hunger, fat storage, and weight gain.\nHigher-fiber carbs\nChoose carbs that are higher in fiber and lower in added sugar. For example, say yes to beans and sweet potatoes. Say no to sugary drinks and chips.\nDrink more water\nDrink more water and fewer sweetened beverages. This one change can cut lots of calories and mean fewer blood sugar swings!\nKeep moving\nPhysical activity helps you stay motivated and keep the weight off.\nLearn from a bad day\nEveryone slips up from time to time. Figure out what went wrong and plan for it next time. You're only human, and humans are great learners.",
            "https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/articles/managing-diabetes-in-the-heat.html": "At a glance\nDid you know that people who have diabetes\u2014either type 1 or type 2\u2014feel the heat more than people who don\u2019t have diabetes? Read on to find out some reasons why.\nHeat affects people with diabetes more\nCertain diabetes complications, such as damage to blood vessels and nerves, can affect your sweat glands so your body can't cool as effectively. That can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which is a medical emergency.\nPeople with diabetes get dehydrated (lose too much water from their bodies) more quickly. Not drinking enough liquids can raise blood sugar, and high blood sugar can make you urinate more, causing dehydration. Some commonly used medicines like diuretics (\"water pills\" to treat high blood pressure) can dehydrate you too.\nHigh temperatures can change how your body uses insulin. You may need to test your blood sugar more often and adjust your insulin dose and what you eat and drink.\nIt's the heat and the humidity\nEven when it doesn't seem very hot outside, the combination of heat and humidity (moisture in the air) can be dangerous. When sweat evaporates (dries) on your skin, it removes heat and cools you. It's harder to stay cool in high humidity because sweat can't evaporate as well.\nWhether you're working out or just hanging out, it's a good idea to check the heat index. The heat index is a measurement that combines temperature and humidity. Take steps to stay cool when it reaches 80\u00b0F in the shade with 40% humidity or above. Important to know: The heat index can be up to 15\u00b0F higher in full sunlight, so stick to the shade when the weather warms up.\nPhysical activity is key to managing diabetes. But don't get active outdoors during the hottest part of the day or when the heat index is high. Get out early in the morning or in the evening when temperatures are lower. Work out at home if you have air-conditioning. Or go to an air-conditioned mall or gym to get active.\nYour blood sugar knows best\nKids out of school, vacations, get-togethers, family reunions. The summer season can throw off your routine, and possibly your diabetes management plan. Check your blood sugar more often to make sure it's in your target range no matter what the summer brings. It's especially important to recognize what low blood sugar feels like and treat it as soon as possible.\nWarm-weather wisdom:\n- Drink plenty of water\u2014even if you're not thirsty\u2014so you don't get dehydrated.\n- Avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine, like coffee, soda, and energy or sports drinks. They can lead to water loss and spike your blood sugar levels.\n- Check your blood sugar before, during, and after you're active. You may need to change how much insulin you use.\n- Wear loose-fitting, lightweight, light-colored clothing.\n- Wear sunscreen and a hat when you're outside. Sunburn can raise your blood sugar levels.\n- Don't go barefoot, even on the beach or at the pool.\n- Use your air conditioner or go to an air-conditioned building or mall to stay cool. In very high heat, a room fan won't cool you enough.\nToo hot to handle\nKnow what else feels the heat? Diabetes medicines, supplies, and equipment.\nDon't store insulin or oral diabetes medicine in direct sunlight or in a hot car. Check package information about how high temperatures can affect insulin and other medicines.\nIf you're traveling, keep insulin and other medicines in a cooler. Don't put insulin directly on ice or on a gel pack.\nHeat can damage your blood sugar monitor, insulin pump, and other diabetes equipment. Don't leave them in a hot car, by a pool, in direct sunlight, or on the beach. The same goes for supplies such as test strips.\nBut don't let the summer heat stop you from taking your diabetes supplies with you when you're out and about. You'll need to be able to test your blood sugar and take steps if it's too high or too low. Just make sure to protect your diabetes gear from the heat.\nStormy weather\nJune 1 marks the beginning of hurricane season. Severe thunderstorms with hail, high winds, and tornadoes are more likely in warm weather too. People with diabetes face extra challenges if the power goes out or they have to seek shelter away from home. Plan how you'll handle medicine that needs refrigeration, such as insulin. And be prepared by packing an emergency go-bag\u2014a supply kit you can grab quickly if you need to leave your home.\nHere's to staying cool, staying safe, and enjoying the long summer days!\nYour summer checklist\n- Drink plenty of water.\n- Test your blood sugar often.\n- Keep medicines, supplies, and equipment out of the heat.\n- Stay inside in air-conditioning when it's hottest.\n- Wear loose, light clothing.\n- Get medical attention for heat-related illness.\n- Make a plan in case you lose power.\n- Have a go-bag ready for emergencies.",

Find out how to adjust your medicines for different time zones and eating schedules, or how to get refills if needed.\nWhile packing, put your diabetes supplies (medicine, blood sugar monitor, etc.) and healthy snacks where you can get to them easily, like in your carry-on bag if you are flying. Pack twice as much medicine as you think you'll need.\nIf you're going through security at the airport there's good news: people with diabetes can bring over 3.4 ounces of liquids through security in their carry-ons. This allows them to travel with liquid medicines, fast-acting sugar sources like juice, or gel packs to keep insulin cool. Finally, be aware that insulin pumps or continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) could be damaged by X-ray machines. Instead of disconnecting your devices, you can ask for a hand inspection.\nWhile you're traveling\nBring healthy foods\nConsider available food options while you travel by car, airplane, or train. If you're driving, bring a cooler with healthy foods and plenty of water. If you're flying, bring options like fruit or nuts so you don't have to resort to unhealthy convenience foods.\nFind healthy options\nSome ideas at airports or roadside restaurants include:\n- Fresh fruit with nuts.\n- Sandwiches on whole wheat bread with grilled chicken or fish.\n- Salad with grilled chicken or fish- limit higher fat toppings such as cheese or creamy dressings.\n- Scrambled or hard boiled eggs.\n- Burgers with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.\n- Fajitas without tortillas and rice.\nPlan medicine and supply storage\nDon't let your medicine and supplies get too hot or too cold. Avoid storing your insulin or other medicines in a hot car, in direct sunlight, or directly on ice. Heat can also damage your blood sugar monitor, insulin pump, and testing strips. Keep your medicines and testing supplies in a cooler with a gel pack. If you're flying, don't keep insulin in a checked bag\u2014it could also get too cold there.\nMove around when you can\nTake breaks from road trips to stretch your legs and walk around. If you're flying or traveling by train, walk up and down the aisles every hour or two to prevent blood clots.\nStay on schedule with medicines\nMany people lose track of time or forget their medicines when they're out of their daily routine. Try setting an alarm on your phone to keep you on track.\nWhen you get there\nCheck your blood sugar often\nCheck regularly to spot any highs or lows from travel. The sooner you discover them, the better you can adjust to get your blood sugar back in your target range. If you're more active or eating less or more than usual, adjust your insulin as instructed by your doctor.\nEnjoy new foods in moderation\nFood can be a big highlight when traveling. You can still enjoy local cuisine but enjoy in moderation. Buffets on cruises can make it easy to eat even when you're not hungry anymore. Moderate your food choices and portion sizes so you don't eat more than you need.\nWatch the heat\nKeep an eye on the temperature if you're traveling somewhere warm. High temperatures, dehydration, and even sunburns can impact your blood sugar.\nDon't forget your feet\nExploring a new place could mean blisters or cuts on your feet. Be sure to check your feet every day, so you can take care of any problems. Avoid walking barefoot, even on the beach.",

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes": "Managing Diabetes\nOn this page:\n- What are the diabetes ABCs?\n- How can a healthy lifestyle help manage my diabetes?\n- What types of medicines should I take?\n- How can I check my blood glucose level at home?\n- How can I keep track of my progress?\n- What special situations should I plan for?\n- Who should be on my health care team?\n- Clinical Trials for Managing Diabetes\nDiabetes can affect almost every part of your body, including your heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes health problems by leading a healthy lifestyle, taking your medicines, and managing your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar level. Work with your health care team to create a diabetes care plan that works for you.\nWhat are the diabetes ABCs?\nThe diabetes ABCs can help you manage your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. If you smoke, quitting is also important. Managing your ABCs may lower your chances of having health problems from diabetes, such as a heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and foot or leg amputations.\nA is for the A1C blood glucose test\nThe A1C test shows your average blood glucose level over the last 3 months. This test is done at a health care professional\u2019s office or lab. For most people with diabetes, their goal is an A1C level below 7%.1 Your A1C goal may be different if you have other health problems.2 Ask your health care team how often you should have the test and what your goal should be.\nB is for blood pressure\nHigh blood pressure can damage your heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. Some people with diabetes have a blood pressure goal below 130/80 mm Hg.2,3 If you have heart disease or are at high risk for diabetes health problems, your goal may be lower. Ask your health care team what your goal should be.\nC is for cholesterol\nCholesterol is a fat, also called lipid, that is produced by your liver. Unhealthy levels of cholesterol in your blood can build up and clog your blood vessels, which may result in a heart attack or a stroke. Ask your health care team how often you need a cholesterol test, also called a lipid panel, and what your cholesterol level should be. Some people may need to take a medicine called a statin, or another medicine, to lower their cholesterol for heart health.\nS is for stop smoking\nNot smoking is important for your health, especially if you have diabetes. Both smoking and diabetes can make your blood vessels narrow. E-cigarettes aren\u2019t a safe option either. If you smoke, vape, or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help so you don\u2019t have to do it alone.\nHow can a healthy lifestyle help manage my diabetes?\nStaying healthy when you have diabetes can be a challenge. But leading a healthy lifestyle may help keep your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in the ranges recommended by your health care team.\nCreate a healthy meal plan\nYou may worry that having diabetes means going without foods you enjoy. The good news is that you can still eat your favorite foods, but you might need to eat smaller portions or enjoy them less often. Work with your health care team, which may include a registered dietitian or a diabetes educator, to create a meal plan that works for you.\nTalk with your health care team about any challenges you may have finding healthy food. A doctor, registered dietician, diabetes educator, or social worker may be able to recommend resources that can help you. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also provides a list of resources about affording healthy food and finding help from food assistance programs.\nGet physical activity\nPhysical activity may help you lower blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Being active may also help you get better sleep and improve your mood. Try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, each week. If you can, try to do muscle-strengthening activities, such as wall push-ups or seated arm raises, two days a week.4\nReach and maintain a healthy weight\nIf you are overweight or have obesity, ask your health care team how you can manage your weight. To lose weight, you may need to consume fewer calories or get more physical activity. Your health care team may also recommend medicines or surgery to help manage your weight.\nGet enough sleep\nGetting enough sleep may improve your mood, energy level, and blood glucose level. Most adults should aim for about 7 to 8 hours each night.5 Children and adolescents may need more sleep.\nTake care of your mental health\nFeeling stressed, sad, or angry can be common for people with diabetes. Many people with chronic, or long-term, illnesses such as diabetes develop anxiety or other mental health conditions. Learn healthy ways to lower your stress, and ask for help from your health care team or a mental health professional.\nWhat types of medicines should I take?\nTaking diabetes medicines is often part of managing diabetes. The medicines you take depend on your type of diabetes, how well medicines control your blood glucose level, and other health conditions you may have. You may also need medicines to help manage blood pressure or cholesterol levels. Other factors such as medicine costs, insurance coverage, who is providing your diabetes care, and your lifestyle can also affect what medicines you take.\nTake your medicines as they were prescribed, even if you feel good or have reached your blood glucose, blood pressure, or cholesterol goals. Avoid rationing your medicines or skipping taking your medicines if you have trouble paying for them. Talk with your health care team if you can\u2019t afford your medicines or if you experience any side effects.\nHow can I check my blood glucose level at home?\nIf you take insulin or other diabetes medicines, checking your blood glucose level at home may help you avoid high or low blood glucose levels. Even if you do not use insulin, checking your blood glucose level at home can help you manage your diabetes. The test results may help you and your health care team make changes to your meal plan, physical activity level, or diabetes medicines. It may help you understand how certain types of food affect your blood glucose level. You do not get the same level of detail from blood tests\u2014such as the A1C test\u2014that you take at a health care professional\u2019s office.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, your health care team may ask you to check your urine at home for substances called ketones. A large amount of ketones in your urine may mean that you need to manage your diabetes more carefully. Work with your primary health care professional\u2014who may be a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner\u2014to change your diabetes care plan. If high levels of ketones are left untreated, you may develop a dangerous condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.\nDevices to help manage diabetes\nYou can check your blood glucose level at home with a blood glucose meter. The meter tests a drop of your blood, usually from a prick of your fingertip. The meter will show you how much glucose is in your blood at that moment.\nPeople who take insulin to manage their diabetes may benefit from using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). A CGM uses a sensor in the tissue under your skin and shows changes in glucose levels throughout the day and night. Many CGM systems have alarms and warnings that let you know if your glucose level is too low or too high.\nFor safety, you may sometimes need to compare your CGM glucose readings with results from a standard blood glucose meter. This could be needed if you doubt the accuracy of your CGM readings, if you are changing your insulin dose, or if your CGM gives a warning alert.\nSome people use a CGM as part of an artificial pancreas. An artificial pancreas is a system that mimics how a healthy pancreas controls blood glucose in the body. A CGM, an insulin pump, and a software program that shares information between the CGM and insulin pump make up the artificial pancreas.\nAsk your health care team about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it. Make sure to keep a record of your blood glucose self-checks, including the date and time you checked it, the results, and other information, such as what you ate or what physical activity you did that day. You can use a chart or a smartphone app to help you keep track. Take this information with you when you visit your health care team.\nRecommended targets for blood glucose levels\nTalk with your health care team about the blood glucose range that is healthy for you. Be sure to tell your health care team if your glucose levels frequently go above or below your target range.\nMany people with diabetes aim to keep their blood glucose at these levels1\n- Before a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL\n- About 2 hours after a meal starts: less than 180 mg/dL\nYour blood glucose goals may be different if you are an adult over age 65 and have had diabetes for a long time. Your blood glucose goals may also be different if you have other health problems, like heart disease, or if your blood glucose often gets too low.\nIf you use a CGM, your health care team may ask you to keep track of your time in range. Time in range is the percentage of time that your glucose level stays in your target range. For many people with diabetes, the target range is between 70 and 180 mg/dL. Your health care team may adjust your diabetes care plan to help you stay in your target range at least 70% of the time.\nLow blood glucose\nWhen your blood glucose level is too low, it is called hypoglycemia. For most people with diabetes, the blood glucose level is too low when it is below 70 mg/dL.1,2 Talk with your primary care professional or health care team if you often have low blood glucose levels. Some people with low blood glucose experience symptoms such as\n- feeling shaky or jittery\n- headache\n- cold sweat\nIf you often have low blood glucose levels, you may need to change your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or medicines. Very low blood glucose may lead to confusion or fainting, and it can become a serious medical emergency that must be treated right away.\nGlucagon\u2014a hormone that raises blood glucose levels\u2014is the best way to treat severely low blood glucose. Ask your health care team if you need a prescription for glucagon. If you have a glucagon prescription, you should teach your family, friends, and coworkers when and how to give you glucagon in case you are not able to do it yourself.\nHigh blood glucose\nWhen your blood glucose level is too high, it is called hyperglycemia. For most people with diabetes, the blood glucose level is too high when it is above 180 mg/dL. Talk with your health care team if you often have high blood glucose levels. Some people with high blood glucose have symptoms such as\n- feeling tired\n- feeling thirsty\n- having blurry vision\n- urinating too often\nIf you often have high blood glucose levels, you may need to make a change to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or medicines. Very high blood glucose may lead to confusion or fainting, and it may become a serious medical emergency that must be treated right away.\nChecking urine for ketones\nYour health care team may want you to check your urine for ketones if you have symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away.\nSymptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include\n- feeling very tired\n- having trouble breathing\n- having fruity-smelling breath\n- fainting\nMost often, ketoacidosis affects people with type 1 diabetes. However, some people with type 2 diabetes can develop ketoacidosis if they do not produce enough insulin.\nHow can I keep track of my progress?\nYou may find it helpful to keep track of your ABCs and other important health information that you get during checkups with your primary care professional or other health care professionals. Download the Health Checkups Tracker (DOCX, 67.97 KB) , which includes information you may want to track. You can take this information with you when you visit your health care team. Talk with your primary care professional about your goals and whether you need to make any changes to your diabetes care plan.\nWhat special situations should I plan for?\nIf you have diabetes, it is important to take care of your health no matter what is going on in your life. Ask your health care team if you should adjust your meal plan, activity level, or medicines in special situations, such as when you are sick, fasting, at school, planning to travel, or experiencing an emergency or natural disaster.\nWho should be on my health care team?\nYou are the most important member of your health care team, but working with your health care team may help you improve your self-care. Most people with diabetes get help from a primary care professional, such as an internal medicine doctor, family doctor, pediatrician, physician assistant, or certified nurse practitioner trained in diabetes care. Ask your primary care professional about adding other members to your team, including\n- a diabetes educator, nurse, or registered dietitian who can tell you more about your disease and how to improve your self-care\n- a dentist to check for gum diseases and other dental problems\n- an eye doctor to check for diabetic eye disease\n- a pharmacist to help you with your medicines\n- other specialists if you develop health problems such as heart disease, kidney disease, erectile dysfunction, or foot problems\n- a social worker who may be able to help you find financial help for diabetes care and community resources\nWrite a list of questions before your visit with a health care professional so you don\u2019t forget what you want to ask.\nClinical Trials for Managing Diabetes\nNIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for managing diabetes?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of clinical studies\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help health care professionals and researchers learn more about diseases and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of managing diabetes, such as\n- what are the best medicines to add to a diabetes care plan if a person with type 2 diabetes isn\u2019t meeting their blood glucose targets using their current diabetes medicines\n- how to train adolescents to support or care for family members with diabetes\n- how treating obesity with weight-loss medicines or weight-loss surgery, also called metabolic and bariatric surgery, may help manage type 2 diabetes\n- what different devices can help people with diabetes check their blood glucose level and inject insulin\nFind out if clinical trials are right for you.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical trials for managing diabetes are looking for participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on managing diabetes that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at ClinicalTrials.gov. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study.\nWhat have we learned about managing diabetes from NIDDK-funded research?\nThe research funded by NIDDK has improved quality of life for people with diabetes by finding better ways to diagnose and treat the disease.\nArtificial pancreas\nFor decades, NIDDK has supported research that helped create artificial pancreas technology used by some people who need insulin to manage their diabetes.\nNIDDK supported research that helped scientists develop the first continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999. CGMs, which are part of artificial pancreas systems, help people track glucose levels in real-time with fewer finger pricks. Another major milestone came in 2016, when the FDA approved a commercial \u201chybrid\u201d artificial pancreas system. Other artificial pancreas systems have been approved since 2016. NIDDK continues to support research into artificial pancreas systems and other technologies that may improve diabetes management.\nBlood glucose management studies\nNIDDK funded the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The study showed that participants with type 1 diabetes who kept their blood glucose levels close to normal greatly lowered their chances of developing eye, kidney, and nerve disease. A follow-up study, the ongoing Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, has continued to follow DCCT participants since 1994. EDIC has shown that there are long-term benefits of early and intensive blood glucose management on slowing or preventing the development of health problems such as heart, eye, kidney, and nerve diseases. Findings from the DCCT and EDIC studies changed the way diabetes is treated worldwide, and they show that blood glucose control can help people with diabetes lead longer and healthier lives.\nNIDDK also funded the Diabetes & Aging Study to research the effects of early blood glucose management and the development of diabetes health problems in people with type 2 diabetes. The study found that people with less effective diabetes management during the first year after being diagnosed with diabetes had a higher risk of diabetes complications and death.\nThe Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study and a follow-up study, TODAY2, found that type 2 diabetes can be more difficult to treat and manage when it occurs in younger people. The TODAY studies, both funded by NIDDK, show the importance of early, intensive treatment and blood glucose management for children or adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes": "What Is Diabetes?\nDiabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Glucose is your body\u2019s main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food you eat.\nInsulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn\u2019t make enough\u2014or any\u2014insulin, or doesn\u2019t use insulin properly. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn\u2019t reach your cells.\nDiabetes raises the risk for damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. Taking steps to prevent or manage diabetes may lower your risk of developing diabetes health problems.\nWhat are the different types of diabetes?\nThe most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.\nType 2 diabetes\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, the cells in your body don\u2019t use insulin properly. The pancreas may be making insulin but is not making enough insulin to keep your blood glucose level in the normal range. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you have risk factors, such as overweight or obesity, and a family history of the disease. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood.\nYou can help delay or prevent type 2 diabetes by knowing the risk factors and taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle, such as losing weight or preventing weight gain.\nGestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you\u2019ve had gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is type 2 diabetes.\nPrediabetes\nPeople with prediabetes have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. You also have a higher risk for heart disease than people with normal glucose levels.\nOther types of diabetes\nA less common type of diabetes, called monogenic diabetes, is caused by a change in a single gene. Diabetes can also come from having surgery to remove the pancreas, or from damage to the pancreas due to conditions such as cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis.\nHow common are diabetes and prediabetes?\nMore than 133 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes.1\nAs of 2019, 37.3 million people\u2014or 11.3% of the U.S. population\u2014had diabetes.1 More than 1 in 4 people over the age of 65 had diabetes. Nearly 1 in 4 adults with diabetes didn\u2019t know they had the disease.2\nAbout 90% to 95% of diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes.3\nIn 2019, 96 million adults\u201438% of U.S. adults\u2014had prediabetes.4\nWhat other health problems can people with diabetes develop?\nOver time, high blood glucose can damage your heart, kidneys, feet, and eyes. If you have diabetes, you can take steps to lower your chances of developing diabetes health problems by taking steps to improve your health and learning how to manage the disease. Managing your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels can help prevent future health problems.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/at-home-medical-tests/": "What are at-home medical tests?\nAt-home medical tests, also known as home use tests, are kits you can buy online or at your local pharmacy or supermarket. These kits allow you to test for, screen, or monitor certain diseases and conditions in the privacy of your own home. Common at-home tests can include:\n- Pregnancy tests.\n- Blood glucose (blood sugar) tests, which may be used regularly to help you manage your diabetes.\n- Fecal occult blood tests, which screen for colon cancer.\n- Tests that check for signs of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, HIV, and COVID-19.\n- Genetic tests, which may show if you are at higher risk for certain diseases.\nThere are two types of at-home tests:\n- Self-tests involve taking a sample of a body fluid, such as blood, urine, or saliva, and applying it to the kit as directed. These tests provide immediate results.\n- Self-collection tests also allow you to take your sample at home, but then you'll need to package it and mail it to a lab. You can get the results from your health care provider, or you may be able to get them in an online portal with a unique login and password. How long it takes to get your results can vary, based on the type of test.\nMany kits are available without a prescription, but you should still ask your provider for advice on which kits to use.\nOther names: home use tests, home test kits\nHow are they used?\nAt-home testing is frequently used to:\n- Find or screen for disorders, such as high cholesterol or certain infections, before you have any symptoms. This may allow you to get treatment earlier and avoid serious complications. It may also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\n- Help diagnose pregnancy early so you can take steps to care for your health and your baby's by scheduling an appointment with your provider.\n- Monitor chronic diseases, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. This may allow you to make more quickly begin making treatment and/or lifestyle changes to improve your condition.\nHow do I use an at-home test?\nThe specific instructions will vary, depending on the type and brand of the test kit. Below are examples of some common at-home tests and how they are performed.\nPregnancy Test\n- Used to diagnose pregnancy by checking for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is normally only produced during pregnancy.\n- Test procedure:\n- If possible, plan to do the test in the morning. Most pregnancy tests recommend using your first morning urine for more accurate results.\n- You will hold a test strip in your urine stream or collect your urine in a cup and place the test strip into the cup.\n- If you are pregnant, the strip will display a colored line, a double line, or a symbol such as a plus sign. The type of display depends on the brand.\nFollow up with your provider if the test is positive or if the test was negative but you still think you might be pregnant.\nGlucose Test\n- Used to monitor blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. This test is essential for some people with diabetes. If your blood glucose gets too high or too low for you, it can cause dangerous complications.\n- Test procedure:\n- You will prick your finger with a device called a lancet to get a drop of blood.\n- You place the blood on a test strip and insert it into a monitor.\n- The meter will show your glucose level.\n- There are different types of glucose meters, and they work in slightly different ways. Some may not even require you to prick your finger. Be sure to read and follow all the instructions carefully.\nFecal Occult Blood Test\n- Used to check stool for signs of colon cancer. Your provider will give you a test kit.\n- Test procedure:\n- You will collect small stool samples and place them on a special card or container.\n- Seal and mail the card or container to your provider or a lab.\n- The sample will be checked for blood. Blood in the stool can be a sign of colon cancer or other conditions.\n- The testing laboratory or your provider will contact you with the results.\nHepatitis C Test\n- Used to find out if you have hepatitis C now or were infected in the past.\n- Test procedure:\n- You will prick your finger with a device called a lancet to get a drop of blood.\n- You place the blood sample on a special piece of paper.\n- You will seal and mail the paper to a laboratory.\n- The testing laboratory or your provider will contact you with the results.\nGenetic Test\n- Used to find out if you may be at higher risk of cancer or other diseases by looking for certain genetic changes. Genetic tests may also be used to find out information about your ancestors. These tests work by comparing your genetic data with genetic data from large groups of people.\n- Test procedure:\n- You can order many of these tests yourself. Others require a provider's prescription.\n- Most test kits will instruct you to provide a saliva sample or to take a swab from the inside of your cheek.\n- You will mail the sample to the test company or as directed.\n- The testing company or your provider will contact you with the results.\nIf you are using a test to find out your risk of disease, be sure to talk to your provider. These tests can't diagnose diseases and are not as accurate as traditional lab-based genetic tests. But if a home test shows you may be at higher risk, your provider can monitor your health more closely.\nCOVID-19 Test\n- Used to find out if you have COVID-19. A viral test tells if you have a current infection. Viral tests can be either rapid tests, which you can do at home, or laboratory tests.\n- Test procedure:\n- Buy a self-test online or at a store.\n- Most test kits will instruct you to take a nasal swab and swirl it inside your nostril.\n- You will place your sample swab in a vial and then place that in the test unit.\n- You will have results in 30 minutes or less displaying whether you have the COVID-19 virus. The type of display may depend on the brand of the test.\n- Follow the test kit instructions.\nIs there anything else I need to know about at-home medical tests?\nAt-home medical tests can provide helpful information, but they are not a replacement for guidance and treatment by your provider. After at-home testing, you should follow up with your provider regardless of the result.\nIn addition, when purchasing and using an at-home test kit:\n- Only use FDA-approved or FDA-authorized tests. The FDA has strict requirements for the quality and accuracy of home test kits.\n- Follow the test instructions exactly. Even minor changes can affect your results.\n- Don't buy or use expired tests. Chemicals in the test may lose their effectiveness over time.\n- Don't change your medicines because of a test result without talking with your provider. Let your provider know about your results. They can tell you if you need to change your medicine or the dose you take based on your at-home test results.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet].

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/blood-glucose-test/": "What is a blood glucose test?\nA blood glucose test measures the glucose levels in your blood. Glucose is a type of sugar. It is your body's main source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. A hormone called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells for use as energy. If you have too much or too little glucose in your blood, it may be a sign of a serious medical condition.\nHigh blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood glucose levels are higher than what is healthy for you, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin or can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. If blood glucose isn't controlled, it can lead to serious, long-term health conditions, such as heart disease and nerve problems.\nHigh blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood, such as problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands, and side effects from certain medicines.\nLow blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) is often caused by certain diabetes medicines for type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, including insulin. In people without diabetes, low blood glucose is much less common. It may be caused by certain medicines and conditions, such as some kidney or liver diseases. Without treatment, severe low blood glucose can lead to major health problems, including seizures and brain damage.\nSeveral types of blood tests check blood glucose levels. Your health care provider will choose the test that's right for you.\nOther names: blood sugar, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting blood glucose (FBG), random blood sugar, glucose challenge test, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\nWhat is it used for?\nA blood glucose test may be used:\n- As part of a routine checkup to screen for prediabetes and diabetes\n- To help diagnose the cause of symptoms that may mean your blood glucose is too high or too low\n- To monitor the side effects of certain long-term medicines that may affect blood glucose\nWhy do I need a blood glucose test?\nYour provider may order a blood glucose test as part of your routine checkup. Routine blood tests that include a glucose test include a basic metabolic panel (BMP) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).\nThe most common reasons for a blood glucose test are to screen for and monitor prediabetes and diabetes. Your provider may order a blood glucose test if:\n- You have a high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Your risk may be high if you:\n- Are over 35 years old. The American Diabetes Association recommends diabetes screening for prediabetes and diabetes beginning at age 35 years and older.\n- Have prediabetes.\n- Are overweight or have obesity.\n- Have a family history of diabetes.\n- Have high blood pressure or heart disease.\n- Have ever had gestational diabetes (diabetes that develops during pregnancy) or given birth to a baby who weighed over 9 pounds.\n- Exercise less than three times a week.\n- Have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n- Are an African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, or an Alaska Native.\nSome Pacific Islander people and Asian American people also have a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes.\n- You have symptoms of high or low glucose levels, which could mean you have diabetes or another condition that affects blood glucose levels.\nSymptoms of high blood glucose levels include:- Increased thirst\n- Frequent urination (peeing)\n- Blurred vision\n- Fatigue\n- Sores that are slow to heal\n- Losing weight without trying\n- Numbness or tingling in your feet or hands\nSymptoms of low blood glucose levels include:- Feeling shaky or jittery\n- Hunger\n- Fatigue\n- Feeling dizzy, confused, or irritable\n- Headache\n- A fast heartbeat or arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n- Having trouble seeing or speaking clearly\n- Fainting or seizures\n- You have prediabetes or diabetes. Your provider may schedule blood glucose tests to monitor your condition. You may also monitor your blood glucose at home.\n- You are pregnant. You will likely have a blood glucose test between the 24th and 28th week of your pregnancy to check for gestational diabetes. If you have a high risk for gestational diabetes, your provider may test you earlier.\n- You take long-term medicines, other than diabetes medicines, that may affect blood glucose levels. Examples of medicines that may cause high blood glucose in some people include certain types of:\nExamples of medicines that may cause low blood glucose in some people include certain types of:\n- ACE inhibitors\n- Antibiotics called quinolones\n- Medicines to treat malaria\nWhat happens during a blood glucose test?\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.\nThere are several types of blood glucose tests:\n- A fasting blood glucose test measures your glucose after you fast (not eating or drinking, except for water) for at least 8 hours. It is often used to:\n- Screen for or monitor prediabetes or diabetes\n- Help diagnose or monitor other conditions that affect blood glucose\n- Check for side effects from medications that can affect blood glucose\n- A random blood glucose test can be done at any time, even after eating. If you have symptoms of diabetes, your provider may use this test first. That's because it can be done right away.\n- A glucose challenge test may be used to screen for gestational diabetes if you are pregnant. You don't need to fast for this test. You will drink a sugary drink that contains glucose. A blood sample is taken one hour later. If your blood glucose is too high, you will usually need an oral glucose tolerance test to confirm or rule out gestational diabetes.\n- An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is used to diagnose gestational diabetes. If you aren't pregnant, it's sometimes used to confirm a diagnosis of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. You will need to fast for this test. A blood sample will be taken before you have a sugary drink. After you have the drink, more blood samples will be taken, usually about every hour for the next 2 or 3 hours.\n- A hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test provides information about your average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. You don't need to fast for this test. It uses one blood sample. An A1C test can diagnose prediabetes and diabetes. Most people with diabetes have an A1C test at least twice a year to check how well they are managing their blood glucose levels.\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nIf your provider orders a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the test. If your glucose test is part of a BMP or CMP test, you may need to fast. Other blood glucose tests don't require any special preparations. Ask your provider whether you need to fast before your glucose test.\nAre there any risks to the test?\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After an oral glucose tolerance test, you may feel light-headed. Your provider may suggest that you plan to have someone take you home.\nWhat do the results mean?\nThe meaning of your test results will depend on which test you had, the results of other tests, and your medical history. Ask your provider what your test results say about your health.\nIn general:\nIf your results show higher than normal glucose levels, it may mean you have or are at risk for getting diabetes. Prediabetes and diabetes are the most common causes of high glucose levels, but other possible causes include:\n- An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n- A problem with your pancreas, including pancreatitis\n- Stress from surgery, very serious illness, or trauma\n- A problem with your adrenal glands, including Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma\n- Certain medicines\nIf you have diabetes, glucose levels that are lower than normal for you may be caused by:\n- Certain diabetes medicines and other medicines that may lower blood glucose\n- Not eating enough, especially after taking diabetes medicine\n- Being more physically active than usual\nIf you don't have diabetes, low blood glucose levels aren't common. If they happen, they may be caused by:\n- Liver or kidney disease\n- Underactive adrenal glands, for example, Addison disease\n- Certain pituitary disorders\n- An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\n- Malnutrition\n- Certain medicines\n- Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nIs there anything else I should know about a blood glucose test?\nIf you have diabetes, you may need to do blood glucose testing at home to help manage your blood glucose levels. Your provider will let you know how often you should test. There are two ways to check your blood glucose. Your provider can help you decide which one is best for you:\n- Blood glucose meters require you to prick your finger with a small device called a lancet. Then, you apply a drop of blood to a test strip and insert it into a small electronic glucose meter, which measures the glucose in your blood.\n- Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) usually use a tiny sensor placed under the skin of your arm or belly. Depending on the type of CGM you use, the sensor stays in place from a week to several months. It automatically estimates your glucose level every few minutes and tracks it so you can see what your blood glucose level is at any time.\nReferences\n- Ahmed FW, Majeed MS, Kirresh O.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/tests-diagnosis": "Diabetes Tests & Diagnosis\nIn this section:\n- Who should be tested for diabetes?\n- What tests are used to diagnose diabetes?\n- What test results tell me if I have diabetes or prediabetes?\n- Which tests help my doctor know what kind of diabetes I have?\nYour doctor can diagnose diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes using blood tests. The blood tests show if your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, is higher than the range that is healthy for you. Blood tests can also help identify the type of diabetes you have.\nDon\u2019t try to diagnose yourself if you think you might have diabetes. Blood testing equipment that you can buy over the counter, such as a blood glucose meter, cannot diagnose diabetes.\nWho should be tested for diabetes?\nAnyone who has symptoms of diabetes should be tested for the disease. Some people will not have any symptoms but may have risk factors for type 2 diabetes and need to be tested. Most pregnant women should also be tested for gestational diabetes. Testing helps doctors find diabetes sooner, so they can work with their patients to manage the disease and prevent health problems.\nIf you have Medicare, it may cover the cost of tests if you have certain risk factors for diabetes. If you have different insurance, ask your insurance company if it covers diabetes tests.\nType 1 diabetes\nDoctors often diagnose type 1 diabetes in children and young adults when they have diabetes symptoms, such as feeling thirsty and having to urinate more often, or if they may have diabetic ketoacidosis. Symptoms in adults may be less specific.1\nType 1 diabetes can run in families. A study called TrialNet offers free testing to relatives of people with type 1 diabetes, even if the relatives don\u2019t have symptoms.\nType 2 diabetes\nExperts recommend routine testing for type 2 diabetes if you have certain risk factors. You may have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you are\n- age 35 or older\n- American Indian, Black or African American, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander\n- overweight or have obesity and have at least one other risk factor\n- a woman who had gestational diabetes\nTake the American Diabetes Association Diabetes Risk Test to see if you are at risk for type 2 diabetes.\nChildren can also develop type 2 diabetes. Experts recommend testing children and teens between the ages of 10 and 18 who are overweight or have obesity and have at least one more risk factor, such as a low birth weight, a parent who had diabetes while pregnant, or another factor.1\nAdults and children with normal diabetes test results should be retested every 3 years.1\nIf your blood glucose levels are higher than the target range, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes, doctors will diagnose you with prediabetes. Having prediabetes is serious because it raises the chance of developing type 2 diabetes. But developing type 2 diabetes can be prevented. Adults and children diagnosed with prediabetes should be tested for type 2 diabetes every year.\nTesting for type 2 diabetes before and during pregnancy\nAll women who are planning to get pregnant should be tested for type 2 diabetes, especially if they have risk factors.\nIf you are already pregnant, you should be tested for type 2 diabetes at the first prenatal appointment, or in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. If you have diabetes, you should receive special care during your pregnancy to avoid problems for you and the baby.\nGestational diabetes\nAll pregnant women who do not have a previous diagnosis of diabetes should be tested for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.1\nIf you have gestational diabetes, you should get tested after your baby is born to see if you have type 2 diabetes, usually within 12 weeks after delivery.\nWhat tests are used to diagnose diabetes?\nDoctors use a variety of tests to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes. Your doctor may recommend different tests depending on whether you have symptoms or not, or whether you are pregnant.\nFasting plasma glucose test\nThe fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test measures your blood glucose level at a single point in time. For the most reliable results, your doctor will give you the test in the morning after you have fasted for at least 8 hours. Fasting means having nothing to eat or drink except sips of water.\nA1C test\nThe A1C test is a blood test that provides your average levels of blood glucose over the last 3 months. Other names for the A1C test are hemoglobin A1C, HbA1C, glycated hemoglobin, and glycosylated hemoglobin test. You can eat and drink before this test. Before using the A1C test to diagnose diabetes, your doctor will consider factors, such as whether you are in your second or third trimester of pregnancy or whether you have certain types of anemia or another problem with your blood.1 The A1C test might not be accurate in those cases.\nCertain types of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin variants, can interfere with measuring A1C levels. Most A1C tests used in the United States are not affected by the most common variants. If your A1C test results and blood glucose levels do not match, your doctor should consider that the A1C test may not be a reliable test for you.\nYour doctor will report your A1C test result as a percentage, such as an A1C of 7%. The higher the percentage is, the higher your average blood glucose levels are.\nRandom plasma glucose test\nSometimes doctors use the random plasma glucose test to diagnose diabetes when you have symptoms of diabetes and they do not want to wait until you have fasted for 8 hours. You may have this blood test at any time.\nGlucose challenge test\nIf you are pregnant, your doctor might test you for gestational diabetes with the glucose challenge test. Another name for this test is the glucose screening test. In this test, a health care professional will take a sample of your blood 1 hour after you drink a sweet liquid containing glucose. You do not need to fast for this test. If your blood glucose level is too high\u2014135 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL or higher\u2014you may need to return for an oral glucose tolerance test while fasting.\nOral glucose tolerance test\nThe oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) helps doctors detect type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes. However, the OGTT is a more expensive test than the FPG test and the glucose challenge test, and it is not as easy to give.\nBefore the test, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours. A health care professional will take a blood sample to measure your glucose level after fasting. Next, you will drink a liquid that is high in sugar. Another blood sample is taken 2 hours later to check your blood glucose level. If your blood glucose level is high, you may have diabetes.\nIf you are pregnant, your blood will be drawn every hour for 2 to 3 hours. If your blood glucose levels are high two or more times during the OGTT, you may have gestational diabetes.\nWhat test results tell me if I have diabetes or prediabetes?\nEach test to detect diabetes and prediabetes uses a different measurement. Usually, your doctor will use a second test to confirm you have diabetes.\nThe table below helps you understand what your test results mean if you are not pregnant.1 If you are pregnant, some tests use different cutoffs. Ask your doctor what your test results mean.\nTest results for diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes\n| Diagnosis | A1C | Fasting Plasma Glucose | Oral Glucose Tolerance Test* | Random Plasma Glucose Test\u2021 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Normal | below 5.7% | 99 mg/dL or below | 139 mg/dL or below | N/A |\n| Prediabetes | 5.7% to 6.4% | 100 to 125 mg/dL | 140 to 199 mg/dL | N/A |\n| Diabetes | 6.5% or above | 126 mg/dL or above | 200 mg/dL or above | 200 mg/dL or above |\nWhich tests help my doctor know what kind of diabetes I have?\nEven though the tests described above can confirm you have diabetes, they can\u2019t identify what type you have\u2014type 1, type 2, or a rare type of diabetes called monogenic diabetes. Treatment can depend on the type of diabetes you have, so knowing which type you have is important.\nGenetic testing\nGenetic testing can diagnose most forms of monogenic diabetes, which is caused by a change\u2014or mutation\u2014in a gene. Anyone can have monogenic diabetes, but it is more common in babies who develop diabetes before they are 6 months old, some teens, and some young adults.\nAutoantibodies\nIf you have diabetes, your doctor may look for certain autoantibodies to see if your diabetes is type 1. Autoantibodies are proteins in your immune system that mistakenly attack your healthy tissues and cells. A health care professional will take a sample of your blood for this test. If autoantibodies for diabetes are found in your blood, you may have type 1 diabetes.1\nIf you do not have diabetes but your parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes, your doctor might give you this test to see if you have a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes. You may want to learn about diabetes symptoms and have follow-up testing as recommended by your doctor.1\nReference\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glucagon-blood-test/": "What is a glucagon blood test?\nThis test measures the amount of glucagon in your blood. Glucagon is a hormone made by your pancreas. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs. Glucagon works with other hormones, like insulin, to help maintain your body's level of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Glucagon increases your blood glucose levels, while insulin decreases your blood glucose levels.\nGlucose is your body's main source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. This causes your blood glucose levels to go up, and less glucagon is released.\nAnd when your blood glucose levels drop, your pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream. But if your pancreas doesn't release the right amount of glucagon, it can lead to serious health problems.\nOther names: glucagon blood test, hypoglycemia-glucagon test, glucagon-plasma\nWhat is it used for?\nA glucagon test is most often used to help diagnose the following conditions:\n- Hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose, occurs when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you. Severe hypoglycemia can be deadly if it's not treated. The condition often affects people with diabetes. It can happen when your diabetes medicines and/or food intake are not at the proper levels.\n- Pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. It can be acute (sudden and short term) or chronic (long term). The systoms of acute pancreatitis are severe and may require immediate medical attention. Chronic pancreatitis gets worse over time and can lead to permanent damage. It symptoms may not appear until there are complications.\n- Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas. It is usually cancerous.\nThe test is also sometimes used to monitor people with diabetes.\nWhy do I need a glucagon blood test?\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of hypoglycemia or a pancreatic tumor.\nSymptoms of hypoglycemia can include:\n- Fast or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n- Tingling in the lips, tongue, or cheeks\n- Anxiety\n- Irritability\n- Sweating\n- Blurred vision\n- Fatigue\n- Pale skin\n- Hunger\nSymptoms of a pancreatic tumor can include:\nWhat happens during a glucagon blood test?\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\nAre there any risks to the test?\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\nWhat do the results mean?\nIf your glucagon levels were not in the normal range, it may be a sign of one of the following conditions:\n- Hypoglycemia\n- Diabetes\n- Acute or chronic pancreatitis\n- Glucagonoma (pancreatic tumor)\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nIs there anything else I need to know about a glucagon blood test?\nA glucagon blood test and a glucagon stimulation test are often called glucagon tests, but they are not the same thing. A glucagon blood test is used to check conditions related to glucose levels, while a glucagon stimulation test checks for problems with growth hormones. It is most often used for infants and children.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995-2024.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glucose-in-urine-test/": "What is a glucose in urine test?\nA glucose in urine test measures the amount of glucose in your urine (pee). Glucose is a type of sugar. It is your body's main source of energy. Glucose comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. Your blood carries glucose to your cells for energy.\nNormally, urine contains very little or no glucose. That's because your kidneys hold on to glucose and send it back to your bloodstream instead of flushing it out of your body in urine. If you have more glucose than normal in your urine, it could mean that you have:\n- Too much glucose in your blood, which could be a sign of diabetes. Diabetes is the most common cause of high urine glucose levels.\n- A rare kidney condition that causes your kidneys to remove glucose from your blood even when your blood glucose levels are normal. These conditions include:\n- Renal glycosuria, a genetic condition that is inherited (passed down through families)\n- Fanconi syndrome, a genetic condition you can inherit or develop later in life (Fanconi syndrome is not related to Fanconi anemia)\nIf your urine glucose levels are high, your health care provider will usually order a blood glucose test to help make a diagnosis.\nOther names: urine sugar test; urine glucose test; glucosuria test; glycosuria test\nWhat is it used for?\nA glucose in urine test is usually part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and other substances in your urine. A urinalysis is often used to check your general health.\nIn the past, urine glucose testing was commonly used to screen for and monitor diabetes. But urine glucose testing is not as accurate as blood glucose testing, so blood tests are now more commonly used to diagnose and monitor diabetes.\nA urine glucose test may still be used to help diagnose and monitor diabetes if you have a condition that makes blood testing difficult. For example, you may not be able to have a blood test if your veins are scarred from past blood tests or if you have a type of bacterial infection that could spread to your blood if a needle is inserted into a vein.\nA glucose in urine test may also be done if your provider thinks you could have an uncommon type of kidney disorder.\nWhy do I need a glucose in urine test?\nYou may have a glucose in urine test as part of your routine checkup. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of diabetes or need to monitor your diabetes, but you are unable to have a blood glucose test.\nSymptoms of diabetes include:\n- Increased thirst and urination\n- Increased hunger\n- Fatigue\n- Blurred vision\n- Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet\n- Sores that don't heal\n- Losing weight without trying\nIf you are pregnant, you will likely have a glucose in urine test as part of a urinalysis to check your health. Some glucose in urine is common during pregnancy. But high levels over time could be a sign of gestational diabetes, which is a type of diabetes that happens only during pregnancy.\nYou may need a glucose in urine test if your provider thinks you could have an uncommon kidney problem that affects how your kidneys filter glucose in blood. These conditions don't always cause symptoms. Your provider may want to test you because you have a family history of one of these conditions.\nWhat happens during a glucose in urine test?\nYou will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the \"clean catch\" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample:\n- Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them.\n- Open the container without touching the inside.\n- Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:\n- For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.\n- For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.\n- Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body.\n- Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed.\n- Finish urinating into the toilet.\n- Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed.\nIf you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.\nYour provider may ask you to monitor your urine glucose at home with a test kit. Your home test kit will come with a package of strips for testing a sample of your urine and instructions on how to do the test. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Talk with your provider about what time of day you should test your urine to get the most accurate results.\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for this test. Some medicines and supplements may affect your test results, so be sure to tell your provider about everything you're taking. But don't stop taking any medicine without talking with your provider first.\nAre there any risks to the test?\nThere is no known risk to having a glucose in urine test.\nWhat do the results mean?\nIf your test result is normal, it means that you had little to no glucose in your urine. But this doesn't mean that you don't have diabetes. You can have a normal urine glucose level when your blood glucose level is high.\nIf your test result shows you have too much glucose in your urine, it may be a sign of:\n- Diabetes (If you have already been diagnosed with diabetes, high urine glucose may mean that your diabetes is not well controlled)\n- Pregnancy\n- Gestational diabetes\n- An uncommon type of kidney disorder\nA urine glucose test alone cannot diagnose any conditions. So, if you have an abnormal test result, your provider may order other tests to help make a diagnosis, including blood tests to diagnose or rule out diabetes.\nToo much urine glucose doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines, vitamin C, and eating a large meal may affect your test results. Ask your provider what your test results mean and whether you need a blood glucose test for more accurate results.\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet].

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/ketones-in-blood/": "What is a ketones in blood test?\nA ketones in blood test measures the level of ketones in your blood. Ketones are acids that your body makes when it breaks down fat for energy.\nNormally, the cells in your body use blood glucose (sugar) for energy. You get glucose from eating carbohydrates. If your cells can't get enough glucose, your body will break down fat for energy instead. This process produces ketones. If your body breaks down fat too fast, ketones can build up in your blood and urine.\nHigh ketone levels make your blood too acidic. This is a serious condition called ketoacidosis. The most common type of ketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a medical emergency that often develops quickly and can lead to a coma and be life-threatening.\nIf you have diabetes, a ketones in blood test can help find high ketone levels early so you can get treatment right away. If your health care provider recommends frequent testing to check for increasing ketone levels, at-home blood testing meters are available that check both glucose levels and ketones. At-home testing for ketones in urine testing may also be an option. Talk with your provider about which is right for you.\nOther names: Ketone bodies (blood), serum ketones, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetate, nitroprusside test\nWhat is it used for?\nWith diabetes:\nA ketones in blood test is mostly used to check for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in people with diabetes. DKA can affect anyone with diabetes, but it is most common with type 1 diabetes. With type 2 diabetes, DKA is less common.\nIf you have diabetes, a blood ketones test may be used when you are sick or pregnant. You may also be tested if you develop diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes).\nIf you don't have diabetes, you may have your blood ketones checked if you are at risk for developing ketoacidosis and you have symptoms. You are at risk for ketoacidosis if you have a condition that causes your body to use fat for energy instead of glucose, such as:\n- An eating disorder\n- Frequent vomiting or diarrhea\n- Alcohol use disorder\nWhy do I need a ketones in blood test?\nYou may need a ketones in blood test if you have diabetes and symptoms of DKA, such as:\n- Feeling very thirsty\n- Urinating (peeing) a lot more than usual\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Abdominal (belly) pain\n- Dry skin and mouth\n- Fast, deep breathing\n- Breath that has a fruity smell\n- Headache\n- Muscle stiffness or aches\n- Fatigue\n- Confusion\nIf you don't have diabetes, you may need a ketones in blood test if you have symptoms of ketoacidosis that could be from another condition. You may also need the test if you have symptoms, and you eat a low-carbohydrate \"keto\" diet for weight loss.\nWhat happens during a ketones in blood test?\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\nTo check blood ketones at home, you may use a blood glucose meter that also tests for ketones. You will use a device to prick your finger. You'll collect a drop of blood on a ketone test strip that is inserted into the meter. The meter will show your ketone levels. Follow the instructions carefully. You can also test for ketones in urine using an at-home kit. Ask your provider how you should test for ketones, when you should test, and what to do if your levels are high.\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nYou don't need any special preparations for a ketones in blood test.\nAre there any risks to the test?\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\nWhat do the results mean?\nA normal or negative test result usually means that your body is not making too many ketones and you don't have ketoacidosis. But a normal test result doesn't always rule out diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). That's because your body makes three types of ketones. If DKA is in the early stages, only one type of ketone will be high, and lab tests often don't measure this type of ketone.\nA high or positive test result means you have ketones in your blood. It's normal to have some blood ketones, but if your levels are very high and you have symptoms, you may have ketoacidosis. If you have diabetes, you likely have DKA. If you don't have diabetes, you may have ketoacidosis from alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, not eating for very long periods of time, or other conditions.\nKetoacidosis from any cause must be treated. Treatment may include going to the hospital.\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nIs there anything else I need to know about a ketones in blood test?\nPeople who eat a low-carbohydrate keto diet to lose weight will have blood ketone levels that are higher, but are not high enough to be ketoacidosis. This condition is called ketosis.\nKetosis doesn't make your blood too acidic because your body is able to use the ketones, so they don't build up. But it's possible to develop ketoacidosis on a keto diet, so it's important to talk with your provider to see if it's safe for you.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet].

At-home urine tests are easy to do and can provide accurate results as long as you carefully follow all the instructions.\nSome people use at-home kits to test for ketones if they are on a ketogenic or \"keto\" diet to try to lose weight. On a keto diet, you eat mainly foods with little or no carbohydrates. This makes your body use fat instead of glucose for energy, which may increase your ketone levels. A keto diet may not be right for people with certain conditions. Talk with your provider before going on a keto diet to see if it is right for you.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995-2024.

Adapted from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\nA1C\nA test that measures a person's average blood glucose (blood sugar) level over the past two to three months. Hemoglobin (HEE-mo-glo-bin) is the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen to the cells and sometimes joins with the glucose in the bloodstream. Also called hemoglobin A1C or glycosylated (gly-KOH-sih-lay-ted) hemoglobin, the test shows the amount of glucose that sticks to the red blood cell, which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the blood.\nAcanthosis nigricans (uh-kan-THO-sis NIH-grih-kans)\nA skin condition characterized by darkened skin patches; common in people whose body is not responding correctly to the insulin that they make in their pancreas (insulin resistance). This skin condition is also seen in people who have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.\nAcute\nDescribes something that happens suddenly and for a short time.

AGEs are produced in the body when glucose links with protein. They play a role in damaging blood vessels, which can lead to diabetes complications.\nAlbuminuria (al-BYOO-mih-NOO-ree-uh)\nA condition in which the urine has more than normal amounts of a protein called albumin. Albuminuria may be a sign of nephropathy (kidney disease).\nAlpha cell (AL-fa)\nA type of cell in the pancreas. Alpha cells make and release a hormone called glucagon. The body sends a signal to the alpha cells to make glucagon when blood glucose (blood sugar) falls too low. Then glucagon reaches the liver where it tells it to release glucose into the blood for energy.\nAmylin (AM-ih-lin)\nA hormone formed by beta cells in the pancreas. Amylin regulates the timing of glucose release into the bloodstream after eating by slowing the emptying of the stomach.\nAmyotrophy (a-my-AH-truh-fee)\nA type of neuropathy resulting in pain, weakness and/or wasting in the muscles.\nAnemia (uh-NEE-mee-uh)\nA condition in which the number of red blood cells is less than normal, resulting in less oxygen being carried to the body's cells.\nAngiopathy (an-gee-AH-puh-thee)\nAny disease of the blood vessels (veins, arteries, capillaries) or lymphatic vessels.\nAntibodies (AN-ti-bod-eez)\nProteins made by the body to protect itself from \"foreign\" substances such as bacteria or viruses.

This lack of fluid keeps your body from working properly and can be caused from frequent urinating, sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting.\nDesensitization (dee-sens-ih-tiz-A-shun)\nReducing response such as an allergic reaction to something. For example, if someone has diabetes and has frequent low blood glucose (blood sugar) levels (hypoglycemia) the body may not react with the same symptoms that would signal that there\u2019s a problem.\nDiabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\nA study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, conducted from 1983 to 1993 in people with type 1 diabetes. The study showed that intensive therapy compared to conventional therapy significantly helped prevent or delay diabetes complications. Intensive therapy included multiple daily insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump with multiple blood glucose (blood sugar) readings each day.
