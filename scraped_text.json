It shows how well you are controlling your blood sugar to help prevent complications from diabetes.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Two methods are available:\n- Blood drawn from a vein. This is done at a lab.\n- Finger stick. This can be done in your health care provider's office. Or, you may be prescribed a kit that you can use at home. Results by finger stick may differ slightly from blood drawn from a vein, but in most cases can also be used to monitor your treatment.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed. The food you have recently eaten does not affect the A1C test, so you do not need to fast to prepare for this blood test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWith a finger stick, you may feel slight pain.\nWith blood drawn from a vein, you may feel a slight pinch or some stinging when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have diabetes. It shows how well you are controlling your diabetes.\nThe test may also be used to screen for diabetes.\nAsk your provider how often you should have your A1C level tested. Usually, for people with diabetes, testing every 3 or 6 months is recommended.\nNormal Results\nThe following are the results when A1C is being used to diagnose diabetes:\n- Normal (no diabetes): Less than 5.7%\n- Pre-diabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%\n- Diabetes: 6.5% or higher\nIf you have diabetes, you and your provider will discuss the ideal range for you, which may vary based on your age. For many people, the goal is to keep the level below 7%.\nThe test result may be incorrect in people with anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, or certain blood disorders (thalassemia), or after a blood transfusion. Talk to your provider if you have any of these conditions. Certain medicines can also result in a false A1C level.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means that you have had a high blood sugar level over a period of weeks to months.\nIf your A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not already have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes.\nIf your level is above 7% and you have diabetes, it often means that your blood sugar is not as well controlled as would be ideal. You and your provider should determine your target A1C.\nMany labs now use the A1C to calculate an estimated average glucose (eAG). This estimate may be different from the average blood sugars you are recording from your glucose meter or continuous glucose monitor. Talk to your provider about what this means. The actual blood sugar readings are usually more reliable than the estimated average glucose based on the A1C.\nThe higher your A1C, the higher the risk that you will develop problems such as:\nIf your A1C stays high, talk to your provider about how best to manage your blood sugar.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n- Excessive bleeding\n- Multiple punctures to locate veins\n- Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n- Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n- Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nHbA1C test; Glycated hemoglobin test; Glycohemoglobin test; Hemoglobin A1C; Diabetes - A1C; Diabetic - A1C\nPatient Instructions\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be performed if:\n- You have or are at risk for type 1 diabetes\n- You appear to have an allergic response to insulin\n- Insulin no longer seems to control your diabetes\n- You are taking insulin to control your diabetes and your blood sugar level varies a lot, with both high and low numbers that can't be explained by the food you are eating relative to the timing of your insulin injections\nNormal Results\nNormally, there are no antibodies against insulin in your blood. Antibodies can be found in the blood of many people who are taking insulin to control diabetes.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe presence of IgG and IgM antibodies against insulin can be part of the testing that diagnoses you with type 1 diabetes.\nIf you develop anti-insulin antibodies, insulin may not work as well, or it may not work at all. As a result, your blood sugar can be very high. Or the antibodies can also put you at risk for low blood sugar.\nYour provider may suggest a different form of insulin to which your body may be less likely to form antibodies.\nIf the test shows a high level of IgE antibody against insulin, your body has developed an allergic response to the insulin.\n- This could put you at risk for skin reactions where you inject insulin. You can also develop more severe reactions that affect your blood pressure or breathing.\n- Medicines, such as antihistamines or low-dose injectable steroids, may help. Or you may need a treatment process called desensitization or a treatment to remove the antibodies from your blood.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003482.htm": "A blood sugar test measures the amount of a sugar called glucose in a sample of your blood.\nGlucose is a major source of energy for most cells of the body, including brain cells. Glucose is a building block for carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are found in fruit, cereal, bread, pasta, and rice. Carbohydrates are quickly turned into glucose in your body. This can raise your blood glucose level.\nThe hormone insulin made in the body helps control the blood glucose level.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThe test may be done in the following ways:\n- After you have not eaten anything for at least 8 hours (fasting)\n- At any time of the day (random)\n- Two hours after you drink a certain amount of glucose (2 hour post-prandial glucose test or oral glucose tolerance test)\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of diabetes. More than likely, the provider will order a fasting blood sugar test.\nThe blood glucose test is also used to monitor people who already have diabetes.\nThe test may also be done if you have:\n- An increase in how often you need to urinate\n- Recently gained a lot of weight\n- Blurred vision\n- Confusion or a change in the way you normally talk or behave\n- Fainting spells\n- Seizures (for the first time)\n- Unconsciousness or coma\nSCREENING FOR DIABETES\nThis test may also be used to screen a person for diabetes.\nHigh blood sugar and diabetes may not cause symptoms in the early stages. A fasting blood sugar test is the most common test done to screen for diabetes, usually starting at age 35. If you have no other diabetes risk factors, you should be tested every 3 years (in some cases, more often if your weight is rising).\nIf you're overweight and have any of the other risk factors below, ask your provider about getting tested at an earlier age and more often:\n- High blood sugar level on a previous test\n- Blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, or unhealthy cholesterol levels\n- History of heart disease\n- Member of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander)\n- Woman who has been previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes\n- Polycystic ovary disease (condition in which a woman has an imbalance of female sex hormones which may cause cysts in the ovaries)\n- Close relative with diabetes (such as a parent, brother, or sister)\n- Not physically active\nChildren age 10 and older who are overweight and have at least two of the risk factors listed above should be tested for type 2 diabetes every 3 years, even if they have no symptoms.\nIn 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was not enough evidence to recommend screening for type 2 diabetes in people 18 years old or younger. Some experts do advocate such screening for overweight children. Ask your child\u2019s provider what is best for them.\nNormal Results\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test, a level of 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L) is considered normal.\nIf you had a random blood glucose test, a normal result depends on when you last ate. Most of the time, the blood glucose level will be 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) or lower.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nBlood glucose measured by a blood test from a vein is considered more accurate than blood glucose measured from a fingerstick with a blood glucose meter, or blood glucose measured by a continuous glucose monitor.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test:\n- A level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) means you have impaired fasting glucose, a type of prediabetes. This increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and you should consult with your provider.\n- A level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher usually means you have diabetes.\nIf you had a random blood glucose test:\n- A level of 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) or higher often means you have diabetes.\n- Your provider will order a fasting blood glucose, A1C test, or glucose tolerance test, depending on your random blood glucose test result.\n- In someone who has diabetes, an abnormal result on the random blood glucose test may mean that the diabetes is not well controlled. Talk with your provider about your blood glucose goals if you have diabetes.\nOther medical problems can also cause a higher-than-normal blood glucose level, including:\n- Overactive thyroid gland\n- Pancreatic cancer\n- Swelling and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n- Stress due to trauma, stroke, heart attack, or surgery\n- Rare tumors, including pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, or glucagonoma\nA lower-than-normal blood glucose level (hypoglycemia) may be due to:\n- Hypopituitarism (a pituitary gland disorder)\n- Underactive thyroid gland or adrenal gland\n- Tumor in the pancreas (insulinoma - very rare)\n- Too little food\n- Too much insulin or other diabetes medicines\n- Liver or kidney disease\n- Weight loss after weight loss surgery\n- Vigorous exercise\nSome medicines can raise or lower your blood glucose level. Before having the test, tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking.\nFor some people, mainly those who are thin and young, a fasting blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) may be normal.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n- Excessive bleeding\n- Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n- Multiple punctures to locate veins\n- Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\n- Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nRandom blood sugar; Blood sugar level; Fasting blood sugar; Glucose test; Diabetic screening - blood sugar test; Diabetes - blood sugar test\nPatient Instructions\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 2.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001214.htm": "Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood.\nCauses\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both.\nTo understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed:\n- A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.\n- An organ in the upper abdomen, below and behind the stomach, called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.\nPeople with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:\n- Their pancreas does not make enough insulin\n- Their cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance)\n- Both of the above\nThere are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:\n- Type 1 diabetes is less common, accounting for 5% to 10% of people with diabetes in the United States. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin are damaged by an immune process and stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the immune process is unknown.\n- Type 2 diabetes is more common, accounting for 90% to 95% of people with diabetes in the United States. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.\n- There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Examples include LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a variant of type 1 diabetes), MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), and diabetes due to other illnesses.\nGestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes.\nIf your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease.\nSymptoms\nA high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:\n- Blurry vision\n- Excess thirst\n- Fatigue\n- Frequent urination\n- Hunger\n- Weight loss\nBecause type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period, usually weeks to months. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.\nAfter many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include:\n- Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, cataracts, and blindness\n- Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot\n- Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction\n- Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure\n- Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections\n- Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke\nExams and Tests\nA urine analysis may show high urine sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.\nYour health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL or higher (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.\nBlood tests:\n- Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two different tests, when the person is in their usual state of health. Levels from 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L to 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.\n- Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher.\n- Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher 2 hours after drinking a special 75 gram sugar drink (this test is used most often for type 2 diabetes and is rarely needed for type 1 diabetes).\nScreening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:\n- Overweight or obese adults (BMI of 25 kilograms per square meter or higher) starting at age 35 repeated every 3 years\n- Overweight women who have other risk factors such as high blood pressure who are planning to become pregnant\n- All adults age 35 or older, repeated every 3 years or at a younger age if the person has risk factors such as high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister, or brother with diabetes\nIn 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was not enough evidence to recommend screening for type 2 diabetes in people 18 years old or younger. Some experts do advocate such screening for overweight children. Ask your child\u2019s provider what is best for them.\nTreatment\nType 2 diabetes can sometimes be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating different foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery.\nThere is no cure for type 1 diabetes (except for a pancreas or islet cell transplant).\nTreating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves nutrition, activity and medicines to control blood sugar level.\nEveryone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES).\nGetting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk for kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.\nTo minimize diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider's instructions on managing your diabetes.\nSupport Groups\nMany resources can help you understand more about diabetes. If you have diabetes, you can also learn ways to manage your condition and prevent diabetes complications.\nMore information and support for people with diabetes and their families can be found at :\n- American Diabetes Association -- www.diabetes.org\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases -- www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDiabetes is a lifelong disease for most people who have it.\nTight control of blood glucose can prevent or delay diabetes complications. But these problems can occur, even in people with good diabetes control.\nPossible Complications\nAfter many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems:\n- You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), cataracts, and light sensitivity. You could become blind.\n- Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body.\n- Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.\n- Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.\n- Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.\n- High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n- Your immune system can weaken, which can lead to frequent infections.\nPrevention\nKeeping an ideal body weight and an active lifestyle may prevent or delay the start of type 2 diabetes. If you're overweight, losing just 5% of your body weight can reduce your risk. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes.\nAt this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But there is promising research that shows type 1 diabetes may be delayed in some high risk people.\nAlternative Names\nDiabetes - type 1; Diabetes - type 2; Diabetes - gestational; Type 1 diabetes; Type 2 diabetes; Gestational diabetes; Diabetes mellitus\nPatient Instructions\nImages\n- Endocrine glands\n- Diabetic retinopathy\n- Islets of Langerhans\n- Pancreas\n- Insulin pump\n- Type I diabetes\n- Diabetic blood circulation in foot\n- Food and insulin release\n- Insulin production and diabetes\n- Monitoring blood glucose - Series\n- Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum - abdomen\n- Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum - leg\nReferences\nAtkinson MA, McGill DE, Dassau E, Laffel L.

Increasing your daily activity by any amount can help improve your health. And there are a lot of ways to add more activity to your day.\nIntroduction\nThere are many benefits to being active. Staying active can:\n- Help control your blood sugar\n- Help control your weight\n- Keep your heart, lungs, and blood vessels healthy\nWhile the focus of activity is often weight loss, you can benefit and become healthier from activity even without losing weight.\nStaying Active at Home\nOne of the best things you can do is get up and start moving. Any activity is better than no activity.\nClean the house. Walk around when you are on the phone. Take frequent, short breaks at least every 30 minutes to get up and walk around when using the computer.\nGet outside of your house and do chores, such as gardening, raking leaves, or washing the car. Play outside with your kids or grandchildren. Take the dog for a walk.\nStaying Active Outside the Home\nFor many people with diabetes, an activity program outside the home is a great option.\n- Talk to your health care provider about your plans and discuss what activities are right for you.\n- Visit the gym or a fitness facility and have an instructor show you how to use the equipment. Pick a gym that has an atmosphere you enjoy and gives you a number of options in terms of activities and locations.\n- When the weather is cold or wet, stay active by walking around in places like a mall.\n- Make sure you are using the right shoes and equipment.\n- Start slowly. A common mistake is to try and do too much too quickly. This can result in muscle and joint injury.\n- Involve friends or family. Activity in a group or with partners is usually more fun and motivating.\nShopping, Running Errands, and Working\nWhen you run errands:\n- Walk as much as you can.\n- If you do drive, park your car in the farthest part of the parking lot.\n- Do not use drive-up windows. Get out of your car and walk inside the restaurant or retailer.\nAt work:\n- Walk over to your co-workers instead of calling, texting, or sending them emails.\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator -- start with 1 floor up or 2 floors down and try to increase over time.\n- Stand up and move around while making phone calls.\n- Stretch or walk around instead of taking a coffee break or snacking.\n- During lunch, walk to the bank or post office, or do other errands that allow you to move around.\nAt the end of your commute, get off the train or bus one stop earlier and walk the rest of the way to work or home.\nIf you want to find out how much activity you are getting during the day, use a wearable activity monitor, a smartphone app, or a step counting device, called a pedometer. Once you know how many steps you average in a day, try to take more steps each day. Your goal for better health should be around 10,000 steps a day, or progressively more steps than you took the day before.\nHealth Risks\nThere are some health risks to beginning new activity programs. Always check with your provider before getting started.\nPeople with diabetes are at increased risk of having heart problems. They don't always sense the warning signs of a heart attack. Ask your provider if you need to be screened for heart disease, particularly if you:\n- Also have high blood pressure\n- Also have high cholesterol\n- Smoke\n- Have a history of heart disease in your family\nPeople with diabetes who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of having arthritis or other joint problems. Talk to your provider if you have had joint pain with activity in the past.\nSome people who are obese may develop skin rashes when they start new exercises. These can often be prevented by choosing the right clothing. If you develop a skin infection or rash, often in skin folds, talk to your provider and make sure it is treated before you continue being active.\nPeople with diabetes and nerve damage in their feet need to be extra careful when starting new activities. Check your feet daily for redness, blisters, or calluses that are starting to form. Always wear socks. Check your socks and shoes for rough spots, which can cause blisters or ulcers. Make sure your toenails are trimmed. Let your provider know right away if you have warmth, swelling, or redness across the top of your foot or your ankle.\nSome types of vigorous exercise (mostly heavier weight lifting) can damage your eyes if you already have diabetic eye disease. Be sure to get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.\nAlternative Names\nPhysical activity - diabetes; Exercise - diabetes\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 5.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000079.htm": "Waiting too long to get medical care when you are sick can lead to getting much sicker. When you have diabetes, a delay in getting care can be life threatening. Even a minor cold can make your diabetes harder to control. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to more serious health problems.\nWhat to Expect at Home\nWhen you are sick, insulin does not work as well in your cells and your blood sugar level can be higher. This can happen even if you are taking the normal doses of your medicines, including insulin.\nWhen you are sick, keep a close watch on diabetes warning signs. These are:\n- High blood sugar that will not come down with treatment\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Low blood sugar that will not rise after you eat\n- Confusion or changes in how you normally behave\nIf you have any of these warning signs and cannot treat them yourself, contact your health care provider right away. Make sure your family members also know the warning signs.\nSick-day Plan\nDiscuss with your provider, before you are sick, how best to handle illnesses. Typical sick day plans are below.\nCheck your blood sugar more often than usual (every 2 to 4 hours). Try to keep your blood sugar at less than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). There may be times when you need to check your blood sugar every hour. Write down or record all your blood sugar levels, the time of each test, and the medicines you have taken.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, check your urine ketones every time you urinate.\nEat small meals often. Even if you are not eating as much, your blood sugar can still get very high. If you use insulin, you may even need extra insulin injections or higher doses.\nDo not do vigorous exercise when you are sick.\nIf you take insulin, you should also have a glucagon emergency treatment kit prescribed by your provider. Always have this kit available.\nDrink Lots of Fluids\nDrink plenty of sugar-free fluids to keep your body from getting dried out (dehydrated). Drink at least twelve 8-ounce (oz) cups (3 liters) of fluid a day.\nFeeling sick often makes you not want to eat or drink, which, surprisingly, can lead to a higher blood sugar.\nFluids you can drink if you are dehydrated include:\n- Water\n- Club soda\n- Diet soda (caffeine-free)\n- Tomato juice\n- Chicken broth\nIf your blood sugar is less than 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) or falling quickly, it is OK to drink fluids that have sugar in them. Try to check their effect on your blood sugar in the same way you check how other foods affect your blood sugar.\nFluids you can drink if your blood sugar is low include:\n- Apple juice\n- Orange juice\n- Grapefruit juice\n- Sports drink\n- Tea with honey\n- Lemon-lime drinks\n- Ginger ale\nIf you throw up, do not drink or eat anything for 1 hour. Rest, but do not lie flat. After 1 hour, take sips of soda, such as ginger ale, every 10 minutes. If vomiting persists, contact or see your provider.\nEating When You are Sick\nWhen you have an upset stomach, try to eat small meals. Try carbohydrates, such as:\n- Bagels or bread\n- Cooked cereal\n- Mashed potatoes\n- Noodle or rice soup\n- Saltines\n- Fruit-flavored gelatin\n- Graham crackers\nMany foods have the right amount of carbohydrates (about 15 grams) for your sick-day diet. Remember, on sick days it is OK to eat some foods you might not normally eat, if you cannot eat your regular foods. Always check the label of foods to be sure you know their carbohydrate content. Some foods to try are:\n- One half cup (120 milliliters, mL) apple juice\n- One half cup (120 mL) regular soft drink (non-diet, caffeine free)\n- One fruit-flavored frozen pop (1 stick)\n- Five small hard candies\n- One slice of dry toast\n- One half cup (120 mL) cooked cereal\n- Six saltine crackers\n- One half cup (120 mL) frozen yogurt\n- One cup (240 mL) sports drink\n- One half cup (120 mL) regular ice cream (if you are not throwing up)\n- One quarter cup (60 mL) sherbet\n- One quarter cup (60 mL) regular pudding (if you are not throwing up)\n- One half cup (120 mL) regular fruit-flavored gelatin\n- One cup (240 mL) yogurt (not frozen), sugar-free or plain\n- Milkshake made with one half cup (120 mL) low-fat milk and one quarter cup (60 mL) ice cream mixed in a blender (if you are not throwing up)\nWhen you are sick, you should try to eat the same amount of carbohydrates that you normally do. If possible, follow your regular diet. If you are having a hard time swallowing, eat soft foods.\nIf you have already taken your insulin and are sick to your stomach, drink enough liquids with the same amount of carbohydrates that you would normally eat. If you cannot keep food or liquids down, go to the emergency room for treatment. You will receive intravenous (IV) fluids.\nIf you have a cold or fever, use your sick day plan or contact your provider.\nDiabetes Medicines\nMost of the time, you should take all of your medicines as you usually do. Do not skip or double up on any medicine unless your provider tells you to.\nIf you cannot eat your normal amount of carbohydrates, use your sick day plan or contact your provider. You may need to make a change in your insulin dose or in the dose of your diabetes pills or other injections. You may also need to do this if your illness is making your blood sugar higher than normal.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nBeing sick increases the risk of more serious emergencies seen with diabetes.\nContact your provider if you have:\n- Blood sugar higher than 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) for more than 1 day\n- Moderate-to-large ketones with your urine tests\n- Vomiting or diarrhea for more than 4 hours\n- Any severe pain or chest pain\n- A fever of 100\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C) or higher\n- Trouble moving your arms or legs\n- Vision, speech, or balance problems\n- Confusion or new memory problems\nIf your provider does not contact you back right away, you may need to go to the emergency room. This is particularly important if you are vomiting or have diarrhea for more than 4 hours.\nAlternative Names\nSick-day management - diabetes; Diabetes - sick day management; Insulin resistance - sick day management; Ketoacidosis - sick day management; Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome - sick day management\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 4.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000083.htm": "Exercise is an important part of managing your diabetes. If you are obese or overweight, exercise can help you manage your weight.\nExercise will Help Your Diabetes\nExercise can help lower your blood sugar without medicines. It reduces your risk of heart disease. Exercise can also lessen the symptoms of depression and reduce stress.\nBut be patient. It may take several months of regular exercising before you see changes in your health. It is important to understand that exercise can benefit your health even if it does not cause much weight loss.\nTalk to Your Doctor First\nYour health care provider should make sure your exercise program is safe for you. An exercise program is safe for most people with diabetes. Your provider may ask about symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg pain that you may get when you walk upstairs or up a hill. In rare cases, your provider will order tests to make sure that you can exercise safely without damaging your heart.\nIf you take medicines that lower your blood sugar, exercise can make your blood sugar go too low. Talk to your provider or nurse about how to take your medicines when you exercise or how to adjust the doses to prevent low blood sugars.\nSome types of vigorous exercise can make your eyes worse if you already have diabetic eye disease. Get an eye exam before starting a new exercise program.\nAfter you start your exercise program, contact your provider if you have any of the following:\n- Feel faint, have chest pain, or feel short of breath when you exercise\n- Feel pain or numbness in your feet. Also contact your provider if you have sores or blisters on your feet\n- Your blood sugar gets too low or too high during or after exercising\nGetting Started\nStart with walking. If you are out of shape, start by walking for 5 to 10 minutes a day.\nTry to set a goal of fast walking. You should do this for 30 to 45 minutes, at least 5 days a week. In order to lose weight, the amount of exercise may need to be greater. So do more if you can. Swimming or exercise classes are also good.\nIf you don't have a safe place to walk, or have pain when walking, you can start with body weight exercises in your home. Talk to your provider about which exercises are right for you.\nWear a bracelet or necklace that says you have diabetes. Tell coaches and exercise partners that you have diabetes. Always have fast-acting sources of sugar with you, such as juice or hard candy. Carry a cell phone with emergency phone numbers with you, as well.\nDrink plenty of water. Do this before, during, and after exercising. Try to exercise at the same time of day, for the same amount of time, and at the same level. This will make your blood sugar easier to control. If your schedule is less regular, exercising at different times of the day is still better than not exercising at all.\nTry to avoid sitting for more than 30 minutes at a time. Get up and stretch. Walk or do some quick exercises like lunges, squats, or wall push-ups.\nYour Blood Sugar and Exercise\nThe blood sugar response to exercise is not always easy to predict. Different types of exercises can make blood sugar go up or down. Most of the time, your response to any specific exercise will be the same. Testing your blood sugar more often is the safest plan.\nCheck your blood sugar before you exercise. Also, check it during exercise if you are working out for more than 45 minutes, especially if this is an exercise you have not done regularly.\nCheck your blood sugar again right after exercise, and later on. Exercise can cause your blood sugar to decrease for up to 12 hours after you are done.\nIf you use insulin, ask your provider when and what you should eat before you exercise. Also, find out how to adjust your insulin dose when you exercise.\nDo not inject insulin in a part of your body that you are exercising, such as the shoulders or thighs.\nKeep a snack nearby that can raise your blood sugar quickly. Examples are:\n- Five or six small soft candies\n- One tablespoon (tbsp), or 15 grams, of sugar, plain or dissolved in water\n- One tbsp, or 15 milliliters (mL) of honey or syrup\n- Three or four glucose tablets\n- One half of a 12-ounce can (355 mL) of regular, non-diet soda or sports drink\n- One half cup (4 ounces or 118 mL) of fruit juice\nHave a larger snack if you will be exercising more than usual. You can also have more frequent snacks. You may need to adjust your medicine if you are planning unusual exercise.\nIf exercise frequently causes your blood sugar to be low, talk with your provider. You may need to lower the dose of your medicine.\nYour Feet and Exercise\nAlways check your feet and shoes for any problems before and after exercise. You might not feel pain in your feet because of your diabetes. You may not notice a sore or blister on your foot. Contact your provider if you notice any changes on your feet. Small problems can become serious if they go untreated.\nWear socks that keep moisture away from your feet. Also, wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes.\nIf you have redness, swelling and warmth across the middle of your foot or ankle after exercise let your provider know right away. This can be a sign of a joint problem that is more common in people with diabetes, called Charcot foot.\nAlternative Names\nExercise - diabetes; Exercise - type 1 diabetes; Exercise - type 2 diabetes\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 5.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000964.htm": "Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Diabetes is a complicated disease. If you have diabetes, or know anyone who has it, you may have questions about the disease. There are many popular myths about diabetes and its management. Here are some facts you should know about diabetes.\nInformation\nMyth: No one in my family has diabetes, so I won't get the disease.\nFact: It's true that having a parent or sibling with diabetes increases your risk for getting diabetes. In fact, family history is a risk factor for both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, many people with diabetes have no close family members with diabetes.\nLifestyle choices and certain conditions can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes. These include:\n- Being overweight or obese\n- Having prediabetes\n- Polycystic ovary disease\n- Gestational diabetes\n- Being of Hispanic/Latino American, African American, American Indian, or Alaska Native descent (some Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans are also at risk)\n- Being age 45 or older\nYou can help reduce your risk by staying at a healthy weight, exercising most days of the week, and eating a healthy diet.\nMyth: I will likely develop diabetes because I am overweight.\nFact: It is true that excess weight increases your chance of having diabetes. However, many people who are overweight or obese never develop diabetes. And people who are normal weight or only a little overweight do develop diabetes. Your best bet is to take steps to lower your risk by using nutritional changes and physical activity to lose excess weight.\nMyth: I eat a lot of sugar, so I am worried I'll get diabetes.\nFact: Eating sugar does not cause diabetes. But you should still cut back on sweets and sugary beverages.\nIt's not surprising that people get confused about whether sugar causes diabetes. This confusion may come from the fact that when you eat food, it is converted into a sugar called glucose. Glucose, also called blood sugar, is a source of energy for the body. Insulin moves glucose from the blood into the cells so it can be used for energy. With diabetes, the body does not make enough insulin, or the body does not use insulin well. As a result, the extra sugar stays in the blood, so the blood glucose (blood sugar) level increases.\nFor people who do not have diabetes, the main problem with eating a lot of sugar and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is that it can make you overweight. And being overweight does increase your risk for diabetes.\nMyth: I was told I have diabetes, so now I'll have to eat a special diet.\nFact: People with diabetes eat the same foods that everyone eats. In fact, The American Diabetes Association no longer recommends specific amounts of carbohydrate, fat, or protein to eat. But they do suggest that people with diabetes get their carbohydrates from vegetables, whole grains, fruits, and legumes. Avoid foods that are high in fat, sodium, and sugar. These recommendations are similar to what everyone should be eating.\nIf you have diabetes, work with your health care provider to develop a meal plan that works best for you and that you will be able to follow consistently over time. A healthy and balanced meal plan with a healthy lifestyle will help you manage diabetes.\nMyth: I have diabetes, so I can never eat sweets.\nFact: Sweets are full of simple sugars, which increase the amount of glucose in your blood more than other foods. But they are not off limits for people with diabetes, as long as you plan for them. It's best to save sweets for special occasions or as a treat. You can eat small amounts of sugar in place of other carbohydrates usually eaten at a meal. If you take insulin your provider may instruct you to take higher doses than normal when you do eat sweets.\nMyth: My provider put me on insulin. This means I am not doing a good job managing my blood sugar.\nFact: People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin because their body no longer produces this important hormone. Type 2 diabetes is progressive, which means that the body makes less insulin over time. So over time, exercise, diet changes, and oral medicines or non-insulin injectable medicines may not be enough to keep your blood sugar in control. Then you need to use insulin to keep blood sugar in a healthy range.\nMyth: It is not safe to exercise with diabetes.\nFact: Getting regular exercise is an important part of managing diabetes. Exercise helps boost your body's sensitivity to insulin. It can also help lower your A1C, a test that helps tell how well your diabetes is controlled.\nA good goal is to aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous exercise like brisk walking. Include two sessions a week of strength training as part of your exercise routine. If you haven't exercised in a while, walking at a brisk pace (you can talk, but not sing) is a great way to slowly build your fitness.\nTalk to your provider to make sure your exercise program is safe for you. Depending on how well-controlled your diabetes is, you will need to prevent and monitor for problems with your eyes, heart, and feet. Also, learn how to take your medicines when you exercise or how to adjust the dosage of medicines, such as insulin, to prevent low blood sugar.\nMyth: I have borderline diabetes, so I don't need to worry.\nFact:Prediabetes is the term used for those whose blood sugar levels are not in the diabetes range but are too high to be called normal. Prediabetes means that you are at high risk for developing diabetes within 10 years. You may be able to lower your blood sugar to normal levels by lowering your body weight and exercising 150 minutes a week.\nTalk to your provider about your risk for diabetes and what you can do to lower your risk.\nMyth: I can stop taking diabetes medicines once my blood sugar is under control.\nFact: Some people with type 2 diabetes are able to control their blood sugar without medicine by losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. But diabetes is a progressive disease, and over time, even if you are doing all you can to stay healthy, you may need medicine to keep your blood sugar within your target range.\nAlternative Names\nDiabetes - common myths and facts; High blood sugar myths and facts\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000082.htm": "People who take control of their own diabetes care by eating healthy foods, living an active lifestyle, and taking medicines as prescribed often have good control of their blood sugar levels. Still, regular health checkups and tests are needed. These visits give you a chance to:\n- Ask your health care provider questions\n- Learn more about your diabetes and what you can do to keep your blood sugar in your target range\n- Make sure you are taking your medicines the right way\nSee Your Doctor\nSee your diabetes provider every 3 to 6 months. During this visit, your provider should check your:\n- Blood pressure\n- Weight\n- Feet\nSee your dentist every 6 months, also.\nIf you are taking insulin or other injections, your provider will also examine your skin to look for signs of reactions to insulin at your injection sites. These may be hard areas or areas where fat under the skin has formed a lump.\nYour provider may also check your abdomen for signs of an enlarged liver.\nEye Exams\nAn eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) should check your eyes every year. See an eye doctor who takes care of people with diabetes.\nIf you have eye problems because of diabetes, you will probably see your eye doctor more often.\nFoot Exams\nYour provider should check the pulses in your feet and your reflexes at least once a year. Your provider should also look for:\n- Calluses\n- Infections\n- Sores\n- Thick toenails\n- Loss of feeling anywhere in your feet (peripheral neuropathy), done with a tool called a monofilament\nIf you have had foot ulcers before, see your provider every 3 to 6 months. It is always a good idea to ask your provider to check your feet.\nHemoglobin A1C Tests\nAn A1C lab test shows how well you are controlling your blood sugar levels over a 3-month period.\nThe normal level is less than 5.7%. Most people with diabetes should aim for an A1C of less than 7%. Some people have a higher target. Your provider will help decide what your target should be.\nHigher A1C numbers mean that your blood sugar is higher and that you may be more likely to have complications from your diabetes.\nCholesterol\nA cholesterol profile test measures cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. You should have this kind of test in the morning, after not eating since the night before.\nMost adults with type 2 diabetes should have this test once a year. People age 40 or over with high cholesterol or on medicines to control their cholesterol may have this test more often.\nBlood Pressure\nBlood pressure should be measured at every visit. Talk to your provider about what your blood pressure goal should be.\nKidney Tests\nOnce a year, you should have a urine test that looks for a protein called albumin.\nYour provider will also have you take a blood test every year that measures how well your kidneys work.\nAlternative Names\nRoutine diabetes tests; Diabetes - prevention\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 4.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000660.htm": "To give an insulin injection, you need to fill the right syringe with the right amount of insulin, decide where to give the injection, and know how to give the injection.\nYour health care provider or a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) will teach you all of these steps, watch you practice, and answer your questions. You may take notes to remember the details. Use the information below as a reminder.\nGetting Ready\nKnow the name and dose of each medicine to give. The type of insulin should match the type of syringe:\n- Standard insulin contains 100 units in 1 milliliter (mL). This is also called U-100 insulin. Most insulin syringes are marked for giving you U-100 insulin. Every small notch on a standard 1 mL insulin syringe is 1 unit of insulin.\n- More concentrated insulins are available. These include U-500 and U-300. Because U-500 syringes may be difficult to find, your provider may give you instructions for using U-500 insulin with U-100 syringes. Insulin syringes or concentrated insulin are now widely available. Do not mix or dilute concentrated insulin with any other insulin.\n- Some types of insulin can be mixed with each other in one syringe, but many cannot be mixed. Check with your provider, CDCES, or pharmacist about this. Some insulins will not work if mixed with other insulins.\n- If you are having trouble seeing the markings on the syringe, talk to your provider or CDCES. Magnifiers are available that clip to your syringe to make the markings easier to see.\n- Many types of insulin come in an injection system called an insulin pen. Ask your provider if this system would be good for you.\nOther general tips:\n- Always try to use the same brands and types of supplies. Do not use expired insulin.\n- Insulin should be given at room temperature. If you have stored it in the refrigerator or cooler bag, take it out 30 minutes before the injection. Once you have started using a vial of insulin, it can be kept at room temperature for 28 days.\n- Gather your supplies: insulin, needles, syringes, alcohol wipes, and a container for used needles and syringes.\nFilling the Syringe - one Type of Insulin\nTo fill a syringe with one type of insulin:\n- Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.\n- Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin. Make sure it is not expired.\n- The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.\n- Intermediate-acting insulin (N or NPH) is cloudy and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. Do not shake the bottle. This can make the insulin clump.\n- Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.\n- If the insulin vial has a plastic cover, take it off. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. Do not blow on it.\n- Know the dose of insulin you are going to use. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of medicine you want.\n- Put the needle into and through the rubber top of the insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle.\n- Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down.\n- With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.\n- Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the insulin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.\n- When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything.\nFilling the Syringe - two Types of Insulin\nTo fill a syringe with two types of insulin:\n- Never mix two types of insulin in one syringe unless you are told to do this. You will also be told which insulin to draw up first. Always do it in that order.\n- Your doctor will tell you how much of each insulin you will need. Add these two numbers together. This is the amount of insulin you should have in the syringe before injecting it.\n- Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.\n- Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin.\n- The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.\n- Intermediate-acting insulin (N or NPH) is cloudy and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. Do not shake the bottle. This can make the insulin clump.\n- Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.\n- If the vial has a plastic cover, take it off. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. Do not blow on it.\n- Know the dose of each insulin you are going to use. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of the longer-acting insulin.\n- Put the needle into the rubber top of that insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle. Remove the needle from the bottle.\n- Put the air in the short-acting insulin bottle the same way as the previous two steps above.\n- Keep the needle in the short-acting bottle and turn the bottle upside down.\n- With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.\n- Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the insulin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.\n- When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Look at it again to make sure you have the right dose.\n- Put the needle into the rubber top of the longer-acting insulin bottle.\n- Turn the bottle upside down. With the tip of the needle in the liquid, slowly pull back on the plunger to exactly the right dose of long-acting insulin. Do not draw extra insulin in the syringe, since you should not push the mixed insulin back into the bottle.\n- Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Remove the needle from the bottle before you push out the air.\n- Make sure you have the right total dose of insulin. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything.\nGiving the Injection\nChoose where to give the injection. Keep a chart of places you have used, so you do not inject the insulin in the same place all the time. Ask your provider or CDCES for a chart.\n- Keep your shots 1 inch (2.5 centimeters, cm) away from scars and 2 inches (5 cm) away from your navel.\n- Do not put a shot in a spot that is bruised, swollen, or tender.\n- Do not put a shot in a spot that is lumpy, firm, or numb (this is a very common cause of insulin not working the way it should).\nThe site you choose for the injection should be clean and dry. If your skin is visibly dirty, clean it with soap and water. Do not use an alcohol wipe on your injection site.\nThe insulin needs to go into the fat layer under the skin.\n- Pinch the skin and put the needle in at a 45\u00ba angle.\n- If your skin tissues are thicker, you may be able to inject straight up and down (90\u00ba angle). Check with your provider before doing this.\n- Push the needle all the way into the skin. Let go of the pinched skin. Inject the insulin slowly and steadily until it is all in.\n- Leave the syringe in place for 5 seconds after injecting.\nPull the needle out at the same angle it went in. Put the syringe down. There is no need to recap it. If insulin tends to leak from your injection site, press the injection site for a few seconds after the injection. If this happens often, check with your provider. You may change the site or the injection angle.\nPlace the needle and syringe in a safe hard container. Close the container, and keep it safely away from children and animals. Never reuse needles or syringes.\nIf you're injecting more than 50 to 90 units of insulin in one injection, your provider may tell you to split the doses either at different times or using different sites for the same injection. This is because bigger volumes of insulin may get weakened without being absorbed. Your provider may also talk to you about switching to a more concentrated type of insulin.\nStoring Your Insulin and Supplies\nAsk your pharmacist how you should store your insulin so it doesn't go bad. Never put insulin in the freezer. Don't store it in your car on warm days.\nAlternative Names\nDiabetes - insulin injection; Diabetic - insulin shot\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 9.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003466.htm": "The glucose tolerance test is a lab test to check how your body moves sugar from the blood into tissues like muscle and fat. The test is often used to diagnose diabetes.\nTests to screen for diabetes during pregnancy are similar, but are done differently.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe most common glucose tolerance test is the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\nBefore the test begins, when you have had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours, a sample of blood will be taken.\nYou will then be asked to drink a liquid containing a certain amount of glucose (usually 75 grams). Your blood will be taken again every 30 to 60 minutes after you drink the solution.\nThe test may take up to 3 hours.\nA similar test is the intravenous (IV) glucose tolerance test (IGTT). It is rarely used, and is never used to diagnose diabetes. In one version of the IGTT, glucose is injected into your vein for 3 minutes. Blood insulin levels are measured before the injection, and again at 1 and 3 minutes after the injection. The timing may vary. This IGTT is almost always used for research purposes only.\nA similar test is used in the diagnosis of growth hormone excess (acromegaly) when both glucose and growth hormone are measured after the glucose drink is consumed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMake sure you eat normally for several days before the test.\nDo not eat or drink anything for at least 8 hours before the test. You cannot eat during the test.\nAsk your health care provider if any of the medicines you take can affect the test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDrinking the glucose solution is similar to drinking very sweet soda.\nSerious side effects from this test are very uncommon. With the blood test, some people feel nauseated, sweaty, lightheaded, or may even feel short of breath or faint after drinking the glucose. Tell your provider if you have a history of these symptoms related to blood tests or medical procedures.\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGlucose is the sugar the body uses for energy. People with untreated diabetes have high blood glucose levels.\nMost often, the first tests used to diagnose diabetes in people who are not pregnant are:\n- Fasting blood glucose level: diabetes is diagnosed if it is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher, on 2 different tests, done when when in a person's normal state of health\n- Hemoglobin A1C test: diabetes is diagnosed if the test result is 6.5% or higher\nGlucose tolerance tests are also used to diagnose diabetes. The OGTT is used to screen for or diagnose diabetes in people with a fasting blood glucose level that is high, but is not high enough (at or above 126 mg/dL or 7 mmol/L) to meet the diagnosis for diabetes.\nAbnormal glucose tolerance (blood sugar goes too high during the glucose challenge) is an earlier sign of diabetes than an abnormal fasting glucose.\nNormal Results\nNormal blood values for a 75 gram OGTT used to check for type 2 diabetes in those who are not pregnant:\nFasting -- 60 to 99 mg/dL (3.3 to 5.5 mmol/L)\n1 hour -- Less than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)\n2 hours -- This value is used to make the diagnosis of diabetes.\n- Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal\n- From 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.1 mmol/L) is considered impaired glucose tolerance\n- A level of 200 mg/dL (11.1mmol/L) or higher is diagnostic of diabetes\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA glucose level that is higher than normal may mean you have pre-diabetes or diabetes:\n- A 2-hour value of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 and 11.1 mmol/L) is called impaired glucose tolerance. Your provider may call this pre-diabetes. It means you are at increased risk of developing diabetes over time.\n- Any glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher is used to diagnose diabetes.\nSerious stress to the body, such as from trauma, stroke, heart attack, or surgery, can raise your blood glucose level. Vigorous exercise can lower your blood glucose level.\nSome medicines can raise or lower your blood glucose level. Before having the test, tell your provider about any medicines you are taking.\nRisks\nYou may have some of the symptoms listed above under the heading titled \"How the Test will Feel.\"\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n- Excessive bleeding\n- Multiple punctures to locate veins\n- Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n- Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n- Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nOral glucose tolerance test - non-pregnant; OGTT - non-pregnant; Diabetes - glucose tolerance test; Diabetic - glucose tolerance test\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 2.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003581.htm": "The glucose urine test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in a urine sample. The presence of glucose in the urine is called glycosuria or glucosuria.\nThe glucose level can also be measured in other bodily fluids using a blood test or a cerebrospinal fluid test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color of the dipstick changes to tells the provider the level of glucose in your urine.\nIf needed, your provider may ask you to collect your urine at home over 24 hours. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines can change the result of this test. Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking. DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test was commonly used to test for and monitor diabetes in the past. Now, blood tests to measure glucose level in the blood are easy to do and are usually used instead of the glucose urine test.\nThe glucose urine test may be ordered when your provider suspects renal glycosuria. This is a rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when the blood glucose level is normal.\nNormal Results\nGlucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed.\nNormal glucose range in urine: 0 to 0.8 mmol/l (0 to 15 mg/dL)\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher than normal levels of glucose may occur with:\n- Diabetes: Small increases in urine glucose levels after a large meal are not always a cause for concern.\n- Pregnancy: Up to half of women have glucose in their urine at some time during pregnancy. Glucose in the urine may mean that a woman has gestational diabetes.\n- Renal glycosuria: A rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when blood glucose levels are normal.\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nUrine sugar test; Urine glucose test; Glucosuria test; Glycosuria test\nImages\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000332.htm": "High blood sugar is also called high blood glucose, or hyperglycemia.\nHigh blood sugar almost always happens in people who have diabetes. High blood sugar occurs when:\n- Your body makes too little insulin.\n- Your body does not respond to the signal insulin is sending.\nInsulin is a hormone that helps the body move glucose (sugar) from the blood into muscle or fat, where it is stored for later use when energy is needed.\nSometimes high blood sugar occurs due to stress from surgery, infection, trauma, or medicines. After the stress is over, blood sugar returns to normal.\nSymptoms of High Blood Sugar\nSymptoms of high blood sugar can include:\n- Being very thirsty or having a dry mouth\n- Having blurry vision\n- Having dry skin\n- Feeling weak or tired\n- Needing to urinate a lot, or needing to get up more often than usual at night to urinate\nYou may have other, more serious symptoms if your blood sugar becomes very high or remains high for a long time. Over time, high blood sugar weakens your immune system and makes it more likely for you to get infections.\nWhat to Think About When Your Blood Sugar is High\nHigh blood sugar can harm you. If your blood sugar is high, you need to know how to bring it down. If you have diabetes, here are some questions to ask yourself when your blood sugar is high:\n- Are you eating right?\n- Are you eating too much?\n- Have you been following your diabetes meal plan?\n- Did you have a meal or a snack with a lot of carbohydrates, starches, or simple sugars?\nAre you taking your diabetes medicines correctly?\n- Has your health care provider changed your medicines?\n- If you take insulin, have you been taking the correct dose? Is the insulin expired? Or has it been stored in a hot or cold place?\n- Are you afraid of having low blood sugar? Is that causing you to eat too much or take too little insulin or other diabetes medicine?\n- Have you injected insulin into a scar or overused area? Have you been rotating sites? Was the injection into a lump or numb spot under the skin?\nWhat else has changed?\n- Have you been less active than usual?\n- Do you have a fever, cold, flu, or another illness?\n- Are you dehydrated?\n- Have you had some stress?\n- Have you been checking your blood sugar regularly?\n- Have you gained weight?\n- Have you started taking any new medicines such as for high blood pressure or other medical problems?\n- Have you had an injection into a joint or other area with a glucocorticoid medicine?\nPreventing High Blood Sugar\nTo prevent high blood sugar, you will need to:\n- Follow your meal plan\n- Stay physically active\n- Take your diabetes medicines as instructed\nYou and your provider will:\n- Set a target goal for your blood sugar levels for different times during the day. This helps you manage your blood sugar.\n- Decide how often you need to check your blood sugar at home.\nIf your blood sugar is higher than your goals over 3 days and you don't know why, check your urine for ketones.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000331.htm": "Immunizations (vaccines or vaccinations) help protect you from some diseases. When you have diabetes, you're more likely to get severe infections because your immune system doesn't work as well. Vaccines can prevent illnesses that can be very serious and can put you in the hospital.\nVaccines usually have an inactive, small part of a certain germ. This germ is often a virus or bacteria. After you get a vaccine, your body learns to attack that virus or bacteria if you are infected. This means you have less of a chance of getting sick than if you did not get the vaccine. Or you may just have a much milder illness.\nBelow are some of the vaccines you need to know about. Ask your health care provider which are right for you.\nPneumococcal Vaccine\nPneumococcal vaccine can help protect you from serious infections due to the pneumococcal bacteria. These infections include:\n- In the blood (bacteremia)\n- Of the covering of the brain (meningitis)\n- In the lungs (pneumonia)\nYou need at least one shot. A second shot may be needed if you had the first shot more than 5 years ago and you are now age 65 years or older.\nMost people have no or only minor side effects from the vaccine. You may have some pain and redness at the site where you get the shot.\nThis vaccine has a very small chance of a serious reaction.\nFlu Shot\nThe flu (influenza) vaccine helps protect you from the flu. Each year, the type of flu virus that makes people sick is different. This is why you should get a flu shot every year. The best time to get the shot is in the early fall, so that you'll be protected all flu season, which usually lasts mid-fall until the following spring.\nPeople with diabetes who are 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine each year.\nThe vaccine is given as a shot (injection). Flu shots can be given to healthy people 6 months or older. One type of shot is injected into a muscle (often the upper arm muscle). Another type is injected just under the skin. Your provider can tell you which shot is right for you.\nIn general, you should not get a flu shot if you:\n- Have a severe allergy to chickens or egg protein\n- Currently have a fever or illness that is more than \"just a cold\"\n- Had a bad reaction to a previous flu vaccine\nThis vaccine has a very small chance of a serious reaction.\nHepatitis B Vaccine\nThe hepatitis B vaccine helps protect you from getting a liver infection due to the hepatitis B virus. People with diabetes ages 19 through 59 years should get the vaccine. Your provider can tell you if this vaccine is right for you.\nOther Important Vaccines\nOther vaccines that you may need are:\n- COVID-19\n- Hepatitis A\n- Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis)\n- MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)\n- Herpes zoster (shingles)\n- Polio\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee website. 5.

A low level (or no C-peptide) indicates that your pancreas is producing little or no insulin.\n- A low level may be normal if you have not eaten recently. Your blood sugar and insulin levels would naturally be low then.\n- A low level is abnormal if your blood sugar is high and your body should be making insulin at that time.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes, obesity, or insulin resistance may have a high C-peptide level. This means their body is producing a lot of insulin to keep (or try to keep) their blood sugar normal.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n- Bleeding\n- Fainting or feeling lightheaded\n- Multiple punctures to try to locate veins\n- Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n- Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nC-peptide\nImages\nReferences\nAtkinson MA, McGill DE, Dassau E, Laffel L.

Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nKetones are substances produced in the liver when fat cells break down in the blood. This test is used to diagnose ketoacidosis. This is a life-threatening problem that affects people who:\n- Have diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA). It occurs when the body cannot use sugar (glucose) as a fuel source because there is not enough insulin. Fat is used for fuel instead. When fat breaks down, waste products called ketones build up in the body.\n- Drink large amounts of alcohol (alcoholic ketoacidosis).\nNormal Results\nA normal test result is negative. This means there are no ketones in the blood.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA test result is positive if ketones are found in the blood. This may indicate:\n- Alcoholic ketoacidosis\n- Diabetic ketoacidosis\n- Starvation\n- Uncontrolled blood glucose in people with diabetes\nOther reasons ketones are found in the blood include:\n- A diet low in carbohydrates can increase ketones (sometimes called a ketogenic diet).\n- After receiving anesthesia for surgery\n- Glycogen storage disease (condition in which the body can't break down glycogen, a form of sugar that is stored in the liver and muscles)\nRisks\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken.

The kit contains dipsticks coated with chemicals that react with ketones. A dipstick is dipped in the urine sample. A color change indicates the presence of ketones.\nThis article describes the ketone urine test that involves sending collected urine to a lab.\nA clean-catch urine sample is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may have to follow a special diet. Your provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that may affect the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nKetone testing is most often done if you have type 1 diabetes and:\n- Your blood sugar is higher than 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)\n- You have nausea or vomiting\n- You have pain in the abdomen\nKetone testing may also be done if:\n- You have an illness such as pneumonia, heart attack, or stroke\n- You have nausea or vomiting that does not go away especially if you take certain medicines\n- You are pregnant\nNormal Results\nA negative test result is normal.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means you have ketones in your urine. The results are typically listed as small, moderate, or large as follows:\n- Small: <20 mg/dL\n- Moderate: 30 to 40 mg/dL\n- Large: >80 mg/dL\nKetones build up when the body needs to break down fats and fatty acids to use as fuel. This is most likely to occur when the body does not get enough sugar or carbohydrates.\nThis may be due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a life-threatening problem that affects people with diabetes. It occurs when the body cannot use sugar (glucose) as a fuel source because there is no insulin or not enough insulin in relation to the amount of glucagon in the blood. Fat is used for fuel instead.\nAn abnormal result may also be due to:\n- Fasting or starvation: such as with anorexia (an eating disorder)\n- High protein or low carbohydrate diet\n- Vomiting over a long period (such as during early pregnancy)\n- Acute or severe illnesses, such as sepsis or burns\n- High fevers\n- The thyroid gland making too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism)\n- Nursing a baby, if the mother does not eat and drink enough\n- Medicines that are sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 inhibitors)\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nKetone bodies - urine; Urine ketones; Ketoacidosis - urine ketones test; Diabetic ketoacidosis - urine ketones test\nReferences\nMurphy M, Srivastava R, Deans K.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000085.htm": "Low blood sugar is a condition that occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) is lower than normal. Low blood sugar may occur in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes. Low blood sugar can cause dangerous symptoms. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to prevent them.\nWhat is Low Blood Sugar?\nLow blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is a cause for immediate action.\nYou are at risk for low blood sugar if you have diabetes and are taking any of the following diabetes medicines:\n- Insulin\n- Glyburide (Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl), repaglinide (Prandin), or nateglinide (Starlix)\nYou are also at increased risk of having low blood sugar if you have had previous low blood sugar levels.\nRecognizing Low Blood Sugar\nKnow how to tell when your blood sugar is getting low. Symptoms include:\n- Weakness or feeling tired\n- Shaking\n- Sweating\n- Headache\n- Hunger\n- Feeling uneasy, nervous, or anxious\n- Feeling cranky\n- Trouble thinking clearly\n- Double or blurry vision\n- Fast or pounding heartbeat\nSometimes your blood sugar may be too low even if you do not have symptoms. If it gets too low, you may:\nSome people who have had diabetes for a long time stop being able to sense low blood sugar. This is called hypoglycemic unawareness. Ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor and sensor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low in order to help prevent symptoms.\nCheck Your Blood Sugar Often\nTalk with your provider about when you should check your blood sugar every day. People who have low blood sugar need to check their blood sugar more often.\nThe most common causes of low blood sugar are:\n- Taking your insulin or diabetes medicine at the wrong time\n- Taking too much insulin or diabetes medicine\n- Taking insulin to correct high blood sugar without eating any food\n- Not eating enough during meals or snacks after you have taken insulin or diabetes medicine\n- Skipping meals (this may mean that your dose of long-acting insulin is too high, so you should talk to your provider)\n- Waiting too long after taking your medicine to eat your meals\n- Exercising a lot or at a time that is unusual for you\n- Not checking your blood sugar or not adjusting your insulin dose before exercising\n- Drinking alcohol\nPreventing Low Blood Sugar\nPreventing low blood sugar is better than having to treat it. Always have a source of fast-acting sugar with you.\n- When you exercise, check your blood sugar levels. Make sure you have snacks with you.\n- Talk to your provider about reducing insulin doses on days that you exercise.\n- Ask your provider if you need a bedtime snack to prevent low blood sugar overnight. Protein snacks may be best.\nDo not drink alcohol without eating food. Women should limit alcohol to 1 drink a day and men should limit alcohol to 2 drinks a day. Family and friends should know how to help. They should know:\n- The symptoms of low blood sugar and how to tell if you have them.\n- How much and what kind of food they should give you.\n- When to call for emergency help.\n- How to inject glucagon, a hormone that increases your blood sugar. Your provider will tell you when to use this medicine.\nIf you have diabetes, always wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. This helps emergency medical workers know you have diabetes.\nWhen Your Blood Sugar Gets Low\nCheck your blood sugar whenever you have symptoms of low blood sugar. If your blood sugar is below 70 mg/dL, treat yourself right away.\n1. Eat something that has about 15 grams (g) of carbohydrates. Examples are:\n- 4 glucose tablets\n- One half cup (4 ounces or 120 mL) of fruit juice or regular, non-diet soda\n- 5 or 6 hard candies\n- 1 tablespoon (tbsp) or 15 mL of sugar, plain or dissolved in water\n- 1 tbsp (15 mL) of honey or syrup\n2. Wait about 15 minutes before eating any more. Be careful not to eat too much. This can cause high blood sugar and weight gain.\n3. Check your blood sugar again.\n4. If you do not feel better in 15 minutes and your blood sugar is still lower than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), eat another snack with 15 g of carbohydrates.\nYou may need to eat a snack with carbohydrates and protein if your blood sugar is in a safer range -- over 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) -- and your next meal is more than an hour away.\nAsk your provider how to manage this situation. If these steps for raising your blood sugar do not work, contact your provider right away.\nTalk to Your Doctor or Nurse\nIf you use insulin and your blood sugar is frequently or consistently low, ask your provider or nurse if you:\n- Are injecting your insulin the right way\n- Need a different type of needle\n- Should change how much insulin you take\n- Should change the kind of insulin you take\nDo not make any changes without talking to your provider or nurse first.\nSometimes hypoglycemia can be due to accidently taking the wrong medicines. Check your medicines with your pharmacist.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nIf signs of low blood sugar do not improve after you have eaten a snack that contains sugar, have someone drive you to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number. Do not drive when your blood sugar is low.\nGet medical help right away for a person with low blood sugar if the person is not alert or cannot be woken up as this is a medical emergency.\nAlternative Names\nHypoglycemia - self care; Low blood glucose - self care\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.

Or, you may need surgery for a medical problem that is unrelated to your diabetes. Your diabetes may increase your risk for problems during or after your surgery, such as:\n- Infection after surgery (especially at the site of the surgery)\n- Healing more slowly\n- Fluid, electrolyte, and kidney problems\n- Heart problems\nBefore Surgery\nWork with your health care provider to come up with the safest surgery plan for you.\nFocus more on controlling your diabetes during the days to weeks before surgery. Stop using tobacco during this time, ideally 6 weeks before surgery.\nYour provider will do a medical exam and talk to you about your health.\n- Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking.\n- If you take metformin, talk to your provider about stopping it. Sometimes, it should be stopped 48 hours before and 48 hours after surgery to decrease the risk of a problem called lactic acidosis.\n- If you take other types of diabetes medicines, follow your provider's instructions about the medicine before surgery. Medicines called SGLT2 inhibitors (\"flozins\") can increase the risk of blood sugar problems related to surgery. Tell your provider if you are taking one of these medicines.\n- If you take insulin, ask your provider what dose you should take the night before or the day of your surgery. Make sure your provider knows whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes as the recommendations to adjust insulin are different.\n- Your provider may have you meet with a dietitian, or give you a specific meal and activity plan to try to make sure your blood sugar is well-controlled for the week prior to your surgery.\n- Some surgeons will cancel or delay surgery if your blood sugar is high when you arrive at the hospital for your surgery.\nSurgery is riskier if you have diabetes complications. So talk to your provider about your diabetes control and any complications you have from diabetes. Tell your provider about any problems you have with your heart, kidneys, or eyes, or if you have loss of feeling in your feet. The provider may run some tests to check the status of those problems.\nDuring Surgery\nYou may do better with surgery and get better faster if your blood sugar is controlled during surgery. So, before surgery, talk to your provider about your blood sugar target level during the days before your operation.\nDuring surgery, insulin may be given by the anesthesiologist. You will meet with this provider before surgery to discuss the plan to control your blood sugar during the operation.\nIf you are taking insulin for your diabetes, ask to schedule your surgery early in the morning to decrease blood sugar problems related to prolonged fasting.\nAfter Surgery\nYou or your nurses should check your blood sugar often. You may have more trouble controlling your blood sugar because you:\n- Have trouble eating\n- Are vomiting\n- Are stressed after surgery\n- Are less active than usual\n- Have pain or discomfort\n- Are given medicines that increase your blood sugar\nExpect that you may take more time to heal because of your diabetes. Be prepared for a longer hospital stay if you are having major surgery. People with diabetes often have to stay in the hospital longer than people without diabetes.\nWatch for signs of infection, such as a fever, or an incision that is red, hot to touch, swollen, more painful, or oozing.\nPrevent bedsores. Move around in bed and get out of bed frequently. If you have less feeling in your toes and fingers, you may not feel if you are getting a bed sore. Make sure you move around.\nAfter you leave the hospital, it is important for you to work with your provider to make sure your blood sugar continues to be well controlled.\nWhen to Call Your Doctor\nContact your provider if:\n- You have any questions about surgery or anesthesia\n- You are not sure what medicines or doses of your medicines you should take or stop taking before surgery\n- You think that you have an infection\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association. 16.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/bloodglucose.html": "Basics\nLearn More\nSee, Play and Learn\nResearch\nResources\nFor You\nSummary\nWhat is blood glucose?\nBlood glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.\nWhat is diabetes?\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems (diabetes complications). So if you have diabetes, it's important to keep your blood glucose levels within your target range.\nWhat are blood glucose targets?\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose target is the range you try to reach as much as possible. The typical targets are:\n- Before a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL\n- Two hours after the start of a meal: Less than 180 mg/dL\nYour blood glucose targets may be different, depending on your age, any additional health problems you have, and other factors. Talk with your health care team about the best target range for you.\nWhen and how should I check my blood glucose?\nIf you have diabetes, you'll likely need to check your blood glucose every day to make sure that your blood glucose numbers are in your target range. Some people may need to check their blood glucose several times a day. Ask your health care team how often you need to check it.\nThe most common way to check your blood glucose level at home is with a blood glucose meter. A blood glucose meter measures the amount of glucose in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip.\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another way to check your glucose levels. Most CGM systems use a tiny sensor that is inserted under your skin. The sensor measures your glucose level every few minutes. It can show changes in your glucose level throughout the day and night. A CGM system is especially useful for people who take insulin and have problems with low blood glucose.\nYour provider will also check your blood glucose with a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood glucose level over the past three months. People with diabetes usually have an A1C test at least twice a year. But you may need the test more often if you aren't meeting your diabetes treatment goals.\nWhat happens if my blood glucose level becomes too high?\nHigh blood glucose is called hyperglycemia. Symptoms that your blood glucose levels may be too high include:\n- Feeling thirsty\n- Feeling tired or weak\n- Headaches\n- Urinating (peeing) often\n- Blurred vision\nIf you often have high blood glucose levels or symptoms of high blood glucose, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.\nHigh blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. These conditions include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands.\nWhat happens if my blood glucose level becomes low for me?\nHypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose, happens when your blood glucose level drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you.\nSymptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:\n- Shaking\n- Sweating\n- Nervousness or anxiety\n- Irritability or confusion\n- Dizziness\n- Hunger\nLow blood glucose levels can be common in people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. If you think you may have low blood glucose, check your level, even if you don't have symptoms. Low blood glucose can be dangerous and should be treated as soon as possible.\nAlthough it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics, can also cause it.

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.\nWhat is gestational diabetes?\nSome people already have diabetes before they get pregnant. But others may develop diabetes during pregnancy. This type of diabetes is called gestational diabetes. It usually develops around the 24th week of pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy. Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy, along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nWho is more likely to develop gestational diabetes?\nAnyone who is pregnant could develop gestational diabetes. But you are more likely to develop it if you:\n- Are overweight or have obesity\n- Have a family history of diabetes\n- Had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy\n- Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more\n- Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n- Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander person\nHow do I know if I have gestational diabetes?\nGestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate (pee) more often.\nIf you are pregnant, you will most likely be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But if you have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit. Your health care provider will use one or more blood glucose tests to check for gestational diabetes. You may have the glucose challenge test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or both.\nFor these two tests, you will drink a sugary liquid and wait for an hour before your blood sample is taken. If you have an oral glucose tolerance test, you will also get your blood drawn after 2 and 3 hours.\nHow can diabetes affect my pregnancy?\nHaving diabetes during pregnancy can affect your health. For example:\n- You are more likely to develop preeclampsia, a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure.\n- You are more likely to need a cesarean delivery, because your baby is more likely to be bigger than average.\n- Changes to your hormones and your body during pregnancy can affect your blood glucose levels. If you had diabetes before pregnancy, you may now need to adjust your meal plan, physical activity routine, and/or medicines. If you have any diabetes health problems, they may get worse during pregnancy.\n- Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you have your baby. But you will be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.\nHaving diabetes during pregnancy can also affect the health of your developing baby:\n- If you have high blood glucose levels at the beginning of your pregnancy, there is a higher risk of birth defects.\n- Your baby will be at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\n- Your baby is more likely to be born early.\n- Your baby may have breathing problems or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels) right after birth.\n- There is a higher risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.\nHow can I manage diabetes during pregnancy?\nThere are steps you can take to manage your diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy.\nIf you already have diabetes, the best time to control your blood glucose is before you get pregnant. High blood glucose levels can be harmful to your developing baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you are pregnant. See your provider to help you plan for pregnancy. You can talk about how to lower the risk of health problems for you and your developing baby. You can also discuss your diet, physical activity, and which diabetes medicines are safe during pregnancy.\nDuring your pregnancy, you will work with your provider to manage your blood glucose levels. You may be able to manage them with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. If that's not enough, then you will need to take diabetes medicines. It's also important that you:\n- Get regular prenatal checkups\n- Take your prenatal vitamins\n- Don't use harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs\nAfter pregnancy, there are steps you need to take to stay healthy:\n- If you had gestational diabetes, you are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You will be tested for it within 4 to 12 weeks after giving birth. Even if your blood glucose levels have returned to normal, you will need to get them tested every 1 to 3 years.\n- If you already had diabetes before pregnancy, you and your provider will monitor changes to your blood glucose levels. They will tell you if you need to adjust your diabetes management plan.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Blood Glucose Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Glucose in Urine Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Am I at Risk for Gestational Diabetes?

The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath. Other types cause tooth decay and cavities.\n- Heart disease and stroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels.\n- Kidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. Many people with diabetes develop high blood pressure. That can also damage your kidneys.\n- Nerve problems (diabetic neuropathy), caused by damage to the nerves and the small blood vessels that nourish your nerves with oxygen and nutrients.\n- Sexual and bladder problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow in the genitals and bladder.\n- Skin conditions, some of which are caused by changes in the small blood vessels and reduced circulation. People with diabetes are also more likely to have infections, including skin infections.\nWhat other problems can people with diabetes have?\nIf you have diabetes, you need to watch out for blood glucose levels that are too high (hyperglycemia) or too low for you (hypoglycemia). These can happen quickly and can become dangerous. Some of the causes include having another illness or infection and certain medicines. They can also happen if you don't get the right amount of diabetes medicines. To try to prevent these problems, make sure to take your diabetes medicines correctly, follow your diabetic diet, and check your blood glucose regularly.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Ketones in Blood (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Ketones in Urine (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Diabetes Care: 10 Ways to Avoid Diabetes Complications (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes, Gum Disease, and Other Dental Problems (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Healthy Weight (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\n- Manage Blood Sugar (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\nLiving With\n- Steps to Prevent or Delay Nerve Damage (American Diabetes Association)\nSpecifics\n- Bone and Joint Problems Associated with Diabetes (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes & Oral Health (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes and DKA (Ketoacidosis) (American Diabetes Association)\n- Diabetes and High Blood Pressure (American Diabetes Association)\n- Diabetes and Skin Complications (American Diabetes Association)\n- Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Stroke (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes, Sexual, and Bladder Problems (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic Coma (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic Hypoglycemia (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic Ketoacidosis (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\n- Gastroparesis (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Hyperglycemia in Diabetes (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\nImages\n- Diabetic Dermopathy (VisualDX)\nClinical Trials\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Diabetes Complications (National Institutes of Health)\nJournal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n- Article: The partial clinical remission phase of type 1 diabetes: early-onset dyslipidemia,...\n- Article: Diabetes Complications among Inpatients with Childhood and Young Adult-Onset Type 1...\n- Article: Therapeutic Challenges of Diabetes Mellitus-Related Erectile Dysfunction and The Potential Therapeutic...\n- Diabetes Complications -- see more articles\nFind an Expert\n- American Diabetes Association\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n- NIDDK Information Clearinghouses and Health Information Center (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)\nMen\n- Erectile Dysfunction and Diabetes: Take Control Today (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\nWomen\n- Diabetes and Women (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\nPatient Handouts\n- Diabetes - preventing heart attack and stroke (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes: Dental Tips (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research) - PDF\n- Diabetic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic ketoacidosis (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish\n- Long-term complications of diabetes (Medical Encyclopedia) Also in Spanish",

It was called juvenile diabetes. With Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose,or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much sugar stays in the blood.\nNow younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to more obesity. With Type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well.\nChildren have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are overweight or have obesity, have a family history of diabetes, or are not active. Children who are African American, Hispanic, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American, or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk. To lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in children:\n- Have them maintain a healthy weight\n- Be sure they are physically active\n- Have them eat smaller portions of healthy foods\n- Limit time with the TV, computer, and video\nChildren and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes may be controlled with diet and exercise. If not, patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or insulin.

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes,your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual. The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.What are the treatments for diabetes?\nTreatments for diabetes can depend on the type. Common treatments include a diabetic meal plan, regular physical activity, and medicines. Some less common treatments are weight loss surgery for either type and an artificial pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.\nWho needs diabetes medicines?\nPeople with type 1 diabetes need to take a diabetes medicine called insulin to control their blood sugar.\nSome people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood sugar with healthy food choices and physical activity. But for others, a diabetic meal plan and physical activity are not enough. They need to take diabetes medicines.\nThe kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes, daily schedule, medicine costs, and any other health conditions that you have. Over time, you may need to take more than one diabetes medicine.\nWhat are the types of medicines for type 1 diabetes?\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin because your body no longer makes it. There are different types of insulin that start to work at different speeds, and the effects of each last a different length of time. Your health care provider will measure your blood glucose to decide on the type of insulin. You may need to use more than one type.\nYou will also need to check your blood sugar at home. Your provider will tell you how often. The results of your blood sugar testing can help you make decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines.\nYou can take insulin several different ways. The most common are with a needle and syringe, an insulin pen, or an insulin pump. If you use a needle and syringe or a pen, you have to take insulin several times during the day, including with meals. An insulin pump gives you small, steady doses throughout the day. Less common ways to take insulin include inhalers, injection ports, and jet injectors.\nIn rare cases, taking insulin alone might not be enough to manage your blood sugar. Then you would need to take another diabetes medicine.\nWhat are the types of medicines for type 2 diabetes?\nThere are several different medicines for type 2 diabetes. Each works in a different way. Many of them are pills. There are also medicines that you inject under your skin, such as insulin.\nOver time, you may need more than one diabetes medicine to manage your blood sugar. You might add another diabetes medicine or switch to a combination medicine. A combination medicine contains more than one type of diabetes medicine in the same pill. Some people with type 2 diabetes take both pills and injections.\nEven if you don't usually take insulin, you may need it at special times, such as during pregnancy or if you are in the hospital.\nWhat else should I know about taking medicines for diabetes?\nEven if you take medicines for diabetes, you still need to eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, take your other medicines, and get regular physical activity. These will help you manage your diabetes.\nIt is important to make sure that you understand your diabetes treatment plan. Talk to your provider about:\n- What your target blood sugar level is\n- What to do if your blood sugar gets too low or too high\n- Whether your diabetes medicines will affect other medicines you take\n- If you will have any side effects from the diabetes medicines\nYou should not change or stop your diabetes medicines on your own.

Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well. The glucose then stays in your blood and not enough goes into your cells.\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors:\n- Being overweight or having obesity\n- Not being physically active\n- Genetics and family history\nType 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.\nWho is at risk for type 2 diabetes?\nYou are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:\n- Are over age 45. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get type 2 diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older people.\n- Have prediabetes, which means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes\n- Had diabetes in pregnancy or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.\n- Have a family history of diabetes\n- Are overweight or have obesity\n- Are Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander\n- Are not physically active\n- Have other conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or depression\n- Have low HDL (good) cholesterol and high triglycerides\n- Have acanthosis nigricans - dark, thick, and velvety skin around your neck or armpits\nWhat are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes?\nMany people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all. If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include:\n- Increased thirst and urination\n- Increased hunger\n- Feeling tired\n- Blurred vision\n- Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands\n- Sores that do not heal\n- Unexplained weight loss\nHow is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?\nYour health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include:\n- A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months\n- Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test.\n- Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood sugar level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.\nWhat are the treatments for type 2 diabetes?\nTreatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine:\n- A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any.\n- Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes.\n- You will need to check your blood sugar regularly. Your health care provider will tell you how often you need to do it.\n- It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly.\nCan type 2 diabetes be prevented?\nYou can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. If you have a condition which raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, managing that condition may lower your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- A1C: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests and Diagnosis (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Insulin in Blood (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Ketones in Blood (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Ketones in Urine (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Find a Lifestyle Change Program (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n- How to Prevent Diabetes: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nTreatments and Therapies\n- Diabetes and Dietary Supplements: What You Need to Know (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Medicines: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Women and Diabetes -- Diabetes Medicines (Food and Drug Administration)\nLiving With\n- Changing Your Habits for Better Health (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes and Mental Health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetic Diet: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Healthy Weight (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\n- How to Stay Healthy With Type 2 Diabetes (Nemours Foundation) Also in Spanish\n- Managing Diabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Your Diabetes Care Team (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\nRelated Issues\n- 5 Things To Know About Type 2 Diabetes and Dietary Supplements (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health)\n- Acanthosis Nigricans (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Health Consequences of Early Exposure to Sugar\n- Healthy Living with Diabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- National Diabetes Prevention Program (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n- Prediabetes:MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Speak Up -- Diabetes: Five Ways to Be Active in Your Care at the Hospital (Joint Commission) - PDF\n- Symptoms and Causes of Diabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\nSpecifics\n- Hyperinsulinemia: Is it diabetes?

Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\nPrediabetes means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\nHow do the foods I eat affect my blood glucose levels?\nThe glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates, or \"carbs.\" Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be.\nWhether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood glucose at a level that is healthy for you. When you control your blood glucose, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes, such as vision loss and heart problems.\nAnd if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood glucose levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on.\nWhat's the best diet for diabetes?\nThere isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator who can help design the best eating plan for you. The plan will consider:\n- Any medicines that you take\n- Your weight\n- Any other health conditions you have\n- Your lifestyle and tastes\n- Your goals\nAll eating plans for diabetes have a few things in common, including eating the right foods in the right amounts at the right times.\nWhat foods should I eat if I have diabetes?\nEating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups:\n- Fruits and vegetables\n- Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats\n- Proteins, such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu\n- Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese\nWhat foods should I limit to control my blood glucose?\nTo keep your blood glucose under control, you may need to cut back on certain foods and drinks. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you will need to have them less often or in smaller amounts.\n- High-carb foods and drinks, such as:\n- Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar\n- Drinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks\n- White rice, tortillas, breads and pasta - especially those made with white flour\n- Starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas\n- Fried foods and other foods high in saturated trans fats.\n- Foods high in sodium (salt).\n- Alcohol. If you do drink, you should drink moderately. This means no more than one standard drink a day if you're a woman or two standard drinks a day if you're a man.\nWhat else do I need to know about diabetic diets?\nIf you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, so that you get the right amount of carbs in each meal or snack. You'll learn how to count carbs and measure your food.\nEating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid blood glucose levels that are too high or too low for you. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful.\nYour eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out.\nEating healthy to control your blood glucose does take some effort. But the reward is a chance to live your healthiest life with diabetes.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nLiving With\n- Carb Counting (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n- Diabetes and Your Diet (American Heart Association)\n- What is the Diabetes Plate Method?

Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.\nWhat eye problems can diabetes cause?\nOver time, high blood glucose may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetic eye problems include:\n- Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye.\n- Diabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (the part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy.\n- Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye.\n- Cataract, which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes.\nWho is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems?\nAnyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you have diabetes and:\n- Have had diabetes for a long time\n- Don't have good control over your high blood glucose or high blood pressure\n- Are pregnant\n- Have high blood cholesterol\n- Smoke tobacco\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?\nIn the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy.\nYou should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could be signs of an emergency. Call your eye care professional right away if you notice any of these symptoms:\n- Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters)\n- Flashes of light\n- A dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain\n- Vision loss\n- Eye pain or redness\nTalk with your eye care professional if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go:\n- Spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision\n- Blurry or wavy vision\n- Vision that changes a lot\n- Trouble seeing colors\nHow are diabetic eye problems diagnosed?\nEye care professionals do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your eye care professional can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. They will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes.\nWhat are the treatments for diabetic eye problems?\nTreatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include:\n- Lasers to stop blood vessels from leaking\n- Injections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing\n- Surgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens\n- Eye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye\nBut these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams. It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in a healthy range.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nSymptoms\n- Eye Symptoms (American Academy of Ophthalmology) Also in Spanish\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Eye Exam and Vision Testing Basics (American Academy of Ophthalmology) Also in Spanish\n- What Are Dilating Eye Drops?

Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual. The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\nHow does diabetes cause foot problems?\nFoot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy, can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet.\nIf you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister, or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet.\nHaving an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene. That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation. This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg. It may prevent a bad infection from spreading and could save your life.\nBut there's a lot you can do to prevent a foot wound from becoming a major health problem.\nHow can I protect my feet if I have diabetes?\nThe best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy.\nGood foot care for people with diabetes includes:\n- Checking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too.\n- Washing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes.\n- Asking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers.\n- Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you.\n- Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble could rub your skin raw.\n- Protecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace.\n- Keeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking.\n- Getting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your health care provider look at your feet.\nWhen should I see my health care provider about diabetic foot problems?\nSerious foot problems can develop quickly. See your health care provider right away if you notice:\n- A cut, blister, or bruise on your feet that doesn't start to heal in a few days\n- Red, warm, or painful skin on your feet\n- A callus with dried blood inside\n- A foot infection that becomes black and smells bad that could be gangrene\nRemember, controlling your blood sugar and caring for your feet every day are the best steps you can take to prevent serious diabetic foot problems.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nLearn More\n- Focus on Your Feet!

Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.\nWhat is diabetic heart disease?\nDiabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don't have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age.\nOver time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including:\n- Coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood.\n- Heart failure. With this condition, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body.\n- Cardiomyopathy. This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff.\nWho is more likely to develop diabetic heart disease?\nDiabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease. It also makes you more likely to develop other conditions that raise your risk even more, including:\n- High blood pressure\n- High blood levels of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol\n- High triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) with low blood levels of HDL \"good\" cholesterol\nYour risk for heart disease is also higher if you\n- Are male\n- Smoke\n- Have obesity\n- Have too much belly fat around your waist, even though you're at a healthy weight:\n- For men, that's a waist more than 40 inches\n- For women, that's a waist more than 35 inches\n- Have a family history of heart disease\n- Have chronic kidney disease\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetic heart disease?\nIn the early stages, heart disease usually doesn't have any symptoms. But if your heart disease worsens, you can have symptoms. Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. They might include:\n- Shortness of breath\n- Fatigue\n- Dizziness or fainting\n- Arrhythmia (problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n- Swollen feet and ankles\n- Chest pain\nIt's important to know that people with diabetes may not feel chest pain. That's because diabetes can damage the nerves in your heart. If you have any symptoms that could be heart disease, talk with your health care provider.\nHow is diabetic heart disease diagnosed?\nTo find out if you have diabetic heart disease, your provider will:\n- Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have\n- Ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had heart disease\n- Do a physical exam\n- Likely run some tests to help understand your personal risk for heart disease, including:\n- Blood tests to check your cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar levels\n- A blood-pressure check\n- Heart tests, if needed\nDepending on your risk level, your provider may send you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for care. If you do have heart disease, treatment will depend on the type of heart disease you have.\nHow can I prevent diabetic heart disease?\nYou may be able to prevent heart disease or keep it from getting worse by working with your provider to:\n- Control your blood sugar levels\n- Manage other conditions you may have that can raise your risk for heart disease\n- Take any medicines your provider prescribed\n- Make heart-healthy habits part of your daily life\n- Follow a healthy eating plan for diabetes\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Heart Health Tests for People with Diabetes (American Heart Association)\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Cholesterol and Diabetes (American Heart Association)\nTreatments and Therapies\n- Chelation for Coronary Heart Disease: What You Need To Know (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health)\nLiving With\n- Diabetes and Your Diet (American Heart Association)\nClinical Trials\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Diabetic Cardiomyopathies (National Institutes of Health)\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Diabetic Heart Disease (National Institutes of Health)\nJournal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\nFind an Expert\n- American Diabetes Association\n- American Heart Association\n- National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n- NIDDK Information Clearinghouses and Health Information Center (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)",

If they are damaged, waste and fluids build up in your blood instead of leaving your body.\nKidney damage from diabetes is called diabetic nephropathy. It begins long before you have symptoms. People with diabetes should get regular screenings for kidney disease. Tests include a urine test to detect protein in your urine and a blood test to show how well your kidneys are working.\nIf the damage continues, your kidneys could fail. In fact, diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure in the United States. People with kidney failure need either dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nYou can slow down kidney damage or keep it from getting worse.

It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.\nFor people with diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.\nWhat is hyperglycemia?\nHyperglycemia means high blood glucose. It most often affects people who have diabetes. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.\nWhat causes hyperglycemia?\nA key part of managing diabetes is controlling your blood glucose levels. To do this, you need to follow a diabetes meal plan and get regular physical activity. You might also need to take diabetes medicines. You have to balance all of these to keep your blood glucose at the right levels. But if you eat too much food or the wrong foods, don't take your medicines correctly, or don't get physical activity, you can get hyperglycemia. It can also happen if you are stressed or sick.\nLess commonly, people who don't have diabetes can also get hyperglycemia. It can be caused by conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. They include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands, certain medicines, and severe illnesses.\nWhat are the symptoms of hyperglycemia?\nThe symptoms of hyperglycemia include:\n- Feeling thirsty\n- Feeling tired or weak\n- Headaches\n- Urinating (peeing) often\n- Blurred vision\nIf you are diabetic and you often have high blood glucose levels or the symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.\nIf you don't have diabetes and you are having these symptoms, see your provider to find out the cause and how to treat it.\nWhat other problems can hyperglycemia cause?\nIf hyperglycemia is not treated, it can cause other problems. In people with diabetes, long-term hyperglycemia can lead to serious health problems (diabetes complications).\nIf your blood glucose levels get very high, you can develop diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). It happens when your body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood glucose into your cells for use as energy. Instead, your liver breaks down fat for fuel. This process produces acids called ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body. This can be life-threatening.\nThe symptoms of DKA may include:\n- Trouble breathing\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Pain in your abdomen (belly)\n- Confusion\n- Feeling very tired or sleepy\nIf you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms. If the test shows that your ketones are moderate or high, or if you don't have a ketones test, contact your health care provider right away or get emergency medical help.\nHow is hyperglycemia diagnosed?\nIf you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too high. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.\nThere are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too high.\nWhat are the treatments for hyperglycemia?\nIf you have diabetes and often have high blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.\nIf you have severe hyperglycemia and are having symptoms of DKA, you will need treatment at the hospital. The treatment often includes I.V. (intravenous) fluids and insulin.\nCan hyperglycemia be prevented?\nIf you have diabetes, managing your diabetes can help prevent hyperglycemia. To manage your diabetes, it's important to:\n- Follow your diabetes meal plan\n- Get regular physical activity\n- If you need diabetes medicines, take them correctly\n- Regularly check your blood glucose level\n- Get regular checkups with your health care team\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- A1C: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Blood Glucose Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nRelated Issues\n- Diabetes and DKA (Ketoacidosis) (American Diabetes Association)\n- Diabetic Ketoacidosis (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research)\nClinical Trials\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Hyperglycemia (National Institutes of Health)\nJournal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n- Article: Effects of Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.)

When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.\nFor people with diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.\nWhat is hypoglycemia?\nHypoglycemia means low glucose. It happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you:\n- For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is too low for you.\n- For people who don't have diabetes, hypoglycemia is typically a blood glucose level lower than 55 mg/dL.\nWhat causes hypoglycemia?\nHypoglycemia is common in people who have diabetes type 1 or who have diabetes type 2 and take insulin or other diabetes medicines. It can happen:\n- As a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. These medicines can lower your blood glucose level.\n- If you don't eat or drink enough carbohydrates (carbs). Carbs are the main source of glucose for your body.\n- If you get a lot more physical activity than usual.\n- If you drink too much alcohol without enough food.\n- When you are sick and can't eat enough food or keep food down.\nAlthough it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). It can also happen in people who have had certain types of weight loss surgery. Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics, can also cause it. See your health care provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.\nWhat are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?\nThe symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:\n- Shaking\n- Sweating\n- Nervousness or anxiety\n- Irritability or confusion\n- Dizziness\n- Hunger\nHow is hypoglycemia diagnosed?\nIf you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too low. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.\nThere are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too low.\nIf you don't have diabetes and you have hypoglycemia, your provider will likely order other tests to try to figure out the cause.\nWhat are the treatments for hypoglycemia?\nIf you have mild or moderate hypoglycemia, eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. But severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or even death. Severe hypoglycemia can be treated with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It can be given as nasal spray or injection. If you have diabetes, your provider can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency.\nIf you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.\nIf you don't have diabetes and you keep having low blood glucose, the treatment will depend on what is causing it to happen.\nCan hypoglycemia be prevented?\nIf you have diabetes and you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, you can help prevent hypoglycemia if you:\n- Follow your diabetes meal plan. Eat and drink enough carbs to keep your blood glucose in your target range. Also carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you in case your blood glucose gets too low.\n- Be safe during physical activity. Check your blood glucose before and afterwards. You may need to eat a snack before your physical activity.\n- If you take diabetes medicines, make sure to take them correctly.\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- Blood Glucose Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- C-Peptide Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Glucagon Blood Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Insulin in Blood (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nSpecifics\n- Diabetic Hypoglycemia (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research) Also in Spanish\n- Hyperinsulinemia: Is it diabetes?

One of these is beta cells, which make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Islet cell transplantation transfers cells from an organ donor into the body of another person. It is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes.\nIn type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin. A person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Transplanted islet cells, however, can take over the work of the destroyed cells. The beta cells in these islets will begin to make and release insulin. Researchers hope islet transplantation will help people with type 1 diabetes live without daily insulin injections.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nLearn More\n- Pancreatic Islet Transplantation (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- What Is Islet Transplantation?

It can allow them to give up insulin shots. An experimental procedure called islet cell transplantation transplants only the parts of the pancreas that make insulin.\nPeople who have transplants must take drugs to keep their body from rejecting the new pancreas for the rest of their lives.

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time.\nIf you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. But if you make some lifestyle changes now, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.\nWhat causes prediabetes?\nPrediabetes usually happens when your body has a problem with insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. A problem with insulin could be:\n- Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use its insulin properly. It makes it hard for your cells to get glucose from your blood. This can cause your blood sugar levels to rise.\n- Your body can't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar levels at a healthy level\nResearchers think that being overweight and not getting regular physical activity are major factors in causing prediabetes.\nWho is at risk for prediabetes?\nAbout 1 out of every 3 adults has prediabetes. It is more common in people who:\n- Are overweight or have obesity\n- Are age 45 or older\n- Have a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes\n- Are African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American\n- Are not physically active\n- Have health conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol\n- Have had gestational diabetes (diabetes in pregnancy)\n- Have a history of heart disease or stroke\n- Have metabolic syndrome\n- Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nWhat are the symptoms of prediabetes?\nMost people don't know they have prediabetes because usually there are no symptoms.\nSome people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpit or on the back and sides of the neck. They may also have many small skin growths in those same areas.\nHow is prediabetes diagnosed?\nThere are a few different blood tests that can diagnose prediabetes. The most common ones are:\n- Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your blood sugar at a single point in time. You need to fast (not eat or drink) for at least 8 hours before the test. The results of the test are given in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter):\n- A normal level is 99 or below\n- Prediabetes is 100 to 125\n- Type 2 diabetes is 126 and above\n- A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar over the past 3 months. The results of an A1C test are given as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been.\n- A normal level is below 5.7%\n- Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%\n- Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5%\nIf I have prediabetes, will I get diabetes?\nIf you have prediabetes, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes:\n- Losing weight, if you are overweight\n- Getting regular physical activity\n- Following a healthy, reduced-calorie eating plan\nIn some cases, your health care provider may also recommend taking diabetes medicines.\nCan prediabetes be prevented?\nIf you are at risk for prediabetes, those same lifestyle changes (losing weight, regular physical activity, and a healthy eating plan) may prevent you from getting it.\nNIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\nDiagnosis and Tests\n- A1C: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Blood Glucose and A1C: Diagnosis (American Diabetes Association)\n- Blood Glucose Test (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\n- Diabetes Tests and Diagnosis (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\nPrevention and Risk Factors\n- Diabetes Risk Factors (American Heart Association)\n- Surprising Truth about Prediabetes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Also in Spanish\nLiving With\n- How to Prevent Diabetes: MedlinePlus Health Topic (National Library of Medicine) Also in Spanish\nRelated Issues\n- Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Stroke (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\n- Insulin Resistance and Prediabetes (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) Also in Spanish\nClinical Trials\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Insulin Resistance (National Institutes of Health)\n- ClinicalTrials.gov: Prediabetic State (National Institutes of Health)\nJournal Articles References and abstracts from MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine)\n- Article: Association Between Circulating Gremlin 2 and \u03b2-Cell Function Among Participants With...\n- Article: Short-term structured dietary and exercise interventions delay diabetes onset in prediabetic...\n- Article: Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) supplementation for twelve weeks improves biomarkers...\n- Prediabetes -- see more articles\nFind an Expert\n- American Diabetes Association\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n- NIDDK Information Clearinghouses and Health Information Center (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)\nChildren\n- Prediabetes in Children -- Five Things Parents Need to Know (Merck & Co., Inc.)

Have you been trying to cut back on less healthy foods? Are you starting to eat better and move more but having a hard time sticking with these changes?\nOld habits die hard. Changing your habits is a process that involves several stages. Sometimes it takes a while before changes become new habits. And, you may face roadblocks along the way.\nAdopting new, healthier habits may protect you from serious health problems like obesity and diabetes. New habits, like healthy eating and regular physical activity, may also help you manage your weight and have more energy. After a while, if you stick with these changes, they may become part of your daily routine.\nThe information below outlines four stages you may go through when changing your health habits or behavior. You will also find tips to help you improve your eating, physical activity habits, and overall health. The four stages of changing a health behavior are\n- contemplation\n- preparation\n- action\n- maintenance\nWhat stage of change are you in?\nContemplation: \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d\nIn this first stage, you are thinking about change and becoming motivated to get started.\nYou might be in this stage if you\n- have been considering change but are not quite ready to start\n- believe that your health, energy level, or overall well-being will improve if you develop new habits\n- are not sure how you will overcome the roadblocks that may keep you from starting to change\nPreparation: \u201cI have made up my mind to take action.\u201d\nIn this next stage, you are making plans and thinking of specific ideas that will work for you.\nYou might be in this stage if you\n- have decided that you are going to change and are ready to take action\n- have set some specific goals that you would like to meet\n- are getting ready to put your plan into action\nAction: \u201cI have started to make changes.\u201d\nIn this third stage, you are acting on your plan and making the changes you set out to achieve.\nYou might be in this stage if you\n- have been making eating, physical activity, and other behavior changes in the last 6 months or so\n- are adjusting to how it feels to eat healthier, be more active, and make other changes such as getting more sleep or reducing screen time\n- have been trying to overcome things that sometimes block your success\nMaintenance: \u201cI have a new routine.\u201d\nIn this final stage, you have become used to your changes and have kept them up for more than 6 months.\nYou might be in this stage if\n- your changes have become a normal part of your routine\n- you have found creative ways to stick with your routine\n- you have had slip-ups and setbacks but have been able to get past them and make progress\nDid you find your stage of change? Read on for ideas about what you can do next.\nContemplation: Are you thinking of making changes?\nMaking the leap from thinking about change to taking action can be hard and may take time. Asking yourself about the pros (benefits) and cons (things that get in the way) of changing your habits may be helpful. How would life be better if you made some changes?\nThink about how the benefits of healthy eating or regular physical activity might relate to your overall health. For example, suppose your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is a bit high and you have a parent, brother, or sister who has type 2 diabetes. This means you also may develop type 2 diabetes. You may find that it is easier to be physically active and eat healthy knowing that it may help control blood glucose and protect you from a serious disease.\nYou may learn more about the benefits of changing your eating and physical activity habits from a health care professional. This knowledge may help you take action.\nLook at the lists of pros and cons below. Find the items you believe are true for you. Think about factors that are important to you.\nHealthy Eating\n| Pros | Cons |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nPhysical Activity\n| Pros | Cons |\n|---|---|\n|\n|\nPreparation: Have you made up your mind?\nIf you are in the preparation stage, you are about to take action. To get started, look at your list of pros and cons. How can you make a plan and act on it?\nThe chart below lists common roadblocks you may face and possible solutions to overcome roadblocks as you begin to change your habits. Think about these things as you make your plan.\n| Roadblock | Solution |\n|---|---|\n| I don\u2019t have time. | Make your new healthy habit a priority. Fit in physical activity whenever and wherever you can. Try taking the stairs or getting off the bus a stop early if it is safe to do so. Set aside one grocery shopping day a week, and make healthy meals that you can freeze and eat later when you don\u2019t have time to cook. |\n| Healthy habits cost too much. | You can walk around the mall, a school track, or a local park for free. Eat healthy on a budget by buying in bulk and when items are on sale, and by choosing frozen or canned fruits and vegetables. |\n| I can\u2019t make this change alone. | Recruit others to be active with you, which will help you stay motivated and safe. Consider signing up for a fun fitness class like salsa dancing. Get your family or coworkers on the healthy eating bandwagon. Plan healthy meals together with your family, or start a healthy potluck once a week at work. |\n| I don\u2019t like physical activity. | Forget the old notion that being physically active means lifting weights in a gym. You can be active in many ways, including dancing, walking, or gardening. Make your own list of options that appeal to you. Explore options you never thought about, and stick with what you enjoy. |\n| I don\u2019t like healthy foods. | Try making your old favorite recipes in healthier new ways. For example, you can trim fat from meats and reduce the amount of butter, sugar, and salt you cook with. Use low-fat cheeses or milk rather than whole-milk foods. Add a cup or two of broccoli, carrots, or spinach to casseroles or pasta. |\nOnce you have made up your mind to change your habits, make a plan and set goals for taking action. Here are some ideas for making your plan:\n- learn more about healthy eating and food portions\n- learn more about being physically active\n- make lists of\n- healthy foods that you like or may need to eat more of\u2014or more often\n- foods you love that you may need to eat less often\n- things you could do to be more physically active\n- fun activities you like and could do more often, such as dancing\nAfter making your plan, start setting goals for putting your plan into action. Start with small changes. For example, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk for 10 minutes, three times a week.\u201d What is the one step you can take right away?\nAction: Have you started to make changes?\nYou are making real changes to your lifestyle, which is fantastic! To stick with your new habits\n- review your plan\n- look at the goals you set and how well you are meeting them\n- overcome roadblocks by planning ahead for setbacks\n- reward yourself for your hard work\nTrack your progress\n- Tracking your progress helps you spot your strengths, find areas where you can improve, and stay on course. Record not only what you did, but how you felt while doing it\u2014your feelings can play a role in making your new habits stick.\n- Recording your progress may help you stay focused and catch setbacks in meeting your goals. Remember that a setback does not mean you have failed. All of us experience setbacks. The key is to get back on track as soon as you can.\n- You can track your progress with online tools such as the NIH Body Weight Planner. The NIH Body Weight Planner lets you tailor your calorie and physical activity plans to reach your personal goals within a specific time period.\nOvercome roadblocks\n- Remind yourself why you want to be healthier. Perhaps you want the energy to play with your nieces and nephews or to be able to carry your own grocery bags. Recall your reasons for making changes when slip-ups occur. Decide to take the first step to get back on track.\n- Problem-solve to \u201coutsmart\u201d roadblocks. For example, plan to walk indoors, such as at a mall, on days when bad weather keeps you from walking outside.\n- Ask a friend or family member for help when you need it, and always try to plan ahead. For example, if you know that you will not have time to be physically active after work, go walking with a coworker at lunch or start your day with an exercise video.\nReward yourself\n- After reaching a goal or milestone, allow for a nonfood reward such as new workout gear or a new workout device. Also consider posting a message on social media to share your success with friends and family.\n- Choose rewards carefully. Although you should be proud of your progress, keep in mind that a high-calorie treat or a day off from your activity routine are not the best rewards to keep you healthy.\n- Pat yourself on the back. When negative thoughts creep in, remind yourself how much good you are doing for your health by moving more and eating healthier.\nMaintenance: Have you created a new routine?\nMake your future a healthy one. Remember that eating healthy, getting regular physical activity, and other healthy habits are lifelong behaviors, not one-time events. Always keep an eye on your efforts and seek ways to deal with the planned and unplanned changes in life.\nNow that healthy eating and regular physical activity are part of your routine, keep things interesting, avoid slip-ups, and find ways to cope with what life throws at you.\nAdd variety and stay motivated\n- Mix up your routine with new physical activities and goals, physical activity buddies, foods, recipes, and rewards.\nDeal with unexpected setbacks\n- Plan ahead to avoid setbacks. For example, find other ways to be active in case of bad weather, injury, or other issues that arise. Think of ways to eat healthy when traveling or dining out, like packing healthy snacks while on the road or sharing an entr\u00e9e with a friend in a restaurant.\n- If you do have a setback, don\u2019t give up. Setbacks happen to everyone. Regroup and focus on meeting your goals again as soon as you can.\nChallenge yourself!\n- Revisit your goals and think of ways to expand them. For example, if you are comfortable walking 5 days a week, consider adding strength training twice a week. If you have limited your saturated fat intake by eating less fried foods, try cutting back on added sugars, too. Small changes can lead to healthy habits worth keeping.\nClinical Trials\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.\nWhat are clinical trials, and are they right for you?\nClinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. Researchers also use clinical trials to look at other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses. Find out if clinical trials are right for you.\nWhat clinical trials are open?\nClinical trials that are currently open and are recruiting can be viewed at ClinicalTrials.gov.\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

DKA is caused by an overload of ketones present in your blood.\nWhen your cells don't get the glucose they need for energy, your body begins to burn fat for energy, which produces ketones. Ketones are chemicals that the body creates when it breaks down fat to use for energy. The body does this when it doesn\u2019t have enough insulin to use glucose, the body\u2019s normal source of energy. When ketones build up in the blood, they make it more acidic. They are a warning sign that your diabetes is out of control or that you are getting sick.\nHigh levels of ketones can poison the body. When levels get too high, you can develop DKA. DKA may happen to anyone with diabetes, though it is rare in people with type 2.\nTreatment for DKA usually takes place in the hospital. But you can help prevent it by learning the warning signs and checking your urine and blood regularly.",
            "https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/mental-health.html": "Key points\n- Untreated mental health issues can make diabetes worse.\n- Problems with diabetes can make mental health issues worse.\n- Fortunately, if one gets better, the other tends to get better too.\nWhy it's important\nIs mental health pretty low on your list of priorities for managing diabetes? This may change your mind.\nMental health has an impact on so many parts of daily life. It affects how you think and feel, handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. You can see how a mental health problem could make it harder to stick to your diabetes care plan.\nThe mind-body connection\nThoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can affect how healthy your body is. Untreated mental health issues can make diabetes worse. Likewise, problems with diabetes can make mental health issues worse. But fortunately if one gets better, the other tends to get better too.\nDepression: more than just a bad mood\nDepression is a medical illness that causes feelings of sadness. It also can cause a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. It can get in the way of how well you function at work and home. That includes taking care of your diabetes. When you aren't able to manage your diabetes well, your risk goes up for diabetes-related health problems.\nPeople with diabetes are 2 to 3 times more likely to have depression than people without diabetes. Only 25% to 50% of people with diabetes who have depression get diagnosed and treated. But treatment\u2014therapy, medicine, or both\u2014is usually very effective. And without treatment, depression often gets worse, not better.\nSymptoms of depression can be mild to severe, and include:\n- Feeling sad or empty\n- Losing interest in favorite activities\n- Overeating or not wanting to eat at all\n- Not being able to sleep or sleeping too much\n- Having trouble concentrating or making decisions\n- Feeling very tired\n- Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty\n- Having aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems\n- Having thoughts of suicide or death\nIf you think you might have depression, get in touch with your doctor right away for help getting treatment. The earlier depression is treated, the better for you, your quality of life, and your diabetes.\nNeed mental health help now?\nStress and anxiety\nStress is part of life, from traffic jams to family demands to everyday diabetes care. You can feel stress as an emotion, such as fear or anger. It can also be a physical reaction like sweating or a racing heart.\nIf you're stressed, you may not take care of yourself as well as usual. Your blood sugar levels can be affected too. Stress hormones make blood sugar rise or fall unpredictably. Stress from being sick or injured can make your blood sugar go up. Being stressed for a long time can lead to other health problems or make them worse.\nAnxiety\u2014feelings of worry, fear, or being on edge\u2014is how your mind and body react to stress. People with diabetes are 20% more likely than those without diabetes to have anxiety. Managing a long-term condition like diabetes is a major source of anxiety for some.\nStudies show that therapy for anxiety usually works better than medicine, but sometimes both together works best. You can also help lower your stress and anxiety by:\nGetting active. Even a quick walk can be calming, and the effect can last for hours.\nDoing some relaxation exercises, like meditation or yoga.\nCalling or texting a friend who understands you (not someone who is causing you stress!).\nGrabbing some \"you\" time. Take a break from whatever you're doing. Go outside, read something fun\u2014whatever helps you recharge.\nTaking care of yourself. Limit alcohol and caffeine, eat healthy food, and get enough sleep.\nAnxiety can feel like low blood sugar and vice versa. It may be hard for you to recognize which it is and treat it effectively. If you're feeling anxious, try checking your blood sugar and treat it if it's low.\nThere will always be some stress in life. But if you feel overwhelmed, talking to a mental health counselor can help. Ask your doctor for a referral.\nDiabetes distress\nYou may sometimes feel discouraged, worried, frustrated, or tired of dealing with daily diabetes care. Maybe you've been trying hard but not seeing results. Or you've developed a health problem related to diabetes in spite of your best efforts.\nThose overwhelming feelings, known as diabetes distress, may cause you to stop taking care of yourself. You may slip into unhealthy habits, stop checking your blood sugar, even skip doctor's appointments.\nIt happens to many\u2014if not most\u2014people with diabetes, often after years of good management.\nDid you know?\nDiabetes distress can look like depression or anxiety, but it can't be treated effectively with medicine. Instead, these approaches have been shown to help:\n- Make sure you're seeing an endocrinologist for your diabetes care. These specialists likely have a deeper understanding of diabetes challenges than your regular doctor.\n- Ask your doctor to refer you to a mental health counselor who specializes in chronic health conditions.\n- Get some one-on-one time with a diabetes educator so you can problem-solve together.\n- Focus on one or two small diabetes management goals instead of thinking you have to work on everything all at once.\nTalk to your health care team\nYour health care team knows diabetes is challenging but may not understand how challenging. And you may not be used to talking about feeling sad or down. But if you're concerned about your mental health, let your doctor know right away. You're not alone\u2014help is available!",
            "https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/healthy-weight.html": "What to know\n- Two ways to find out if you're at a healthy weight: body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.\n- Losing weight doesn't have to mean losing a lot of weight.\n- Willpower isn't the long-term answer for weight loss\u2014read on to find out what is.\nWhat is a healthy weight?\nIs it the weight you think you should be? The same as you weighed 20 years ago? Ten pounds less than your sister-in-law? We can't provide an exact number for you. But we can give you some pointers on how to get to a healthy weight and stay there.\nTwo ways to get an idea if your weight is healthy or not: body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.\nBMI\nBMI measures your height compared to your weight. For example, a person who is 5'7\" and weighs 170 pounds has a BMI of 26.6, which is in the overweight range.\nBMI ranges\nUnderweight: less than 18.5\nNormal: 18.5\u201324.9\nOverweight: 25\u201329.9\nObesity: 30 or greater\nBut experts note that BMI doesn't measure belly fat, and that's important. Too much belly fat can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.\nWaist circumference\nWaist circumference (waist size) takes belly fat into account. It helps predict your risk of health problems from being overweight. Women whose waist measures more than 35 inches are at higher risk. So are men whose waist measures more than 40 inches. Losing weight can reduce belly fat and lower that risk!\nTo measure your waist correctly, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hip bones. Breathe in, and then measure your waist just after you breathe out.\nGetting started\nLosing weight doesn't have to mean losing a lot of weight. Taking off just 5% to 10% can improve your health and well-being. That's 10 to 20 pounds for a 200-pound person.\nIf you have diabetes, you may find your blood sugar levels are easier to manage after you lose weight. You may also need less diabetes medicine. Many people who lose weight notice that they have more energy and sleep better too.\nA healthy weight goal is one thing; dropping the pounds is quite another. If there were an easy way to lose weight and keep it off, everyone would be doing it. We've all known someone who follows a popular diet plan and loses weight fast. But then they gain it all back (and then some). After trying and failing over and over, it's easy to see why people give up.\nSuccess!\nFood for life\nInstead, create an eating plan that you can follow for life. It just needs two key ingredients:\n- It's based on healthy food.\n- You can keep doing it long term.\nWith that in mind, you may need to try different things to figure out what works for you. Some people cut back on sugar and eat more protein to stay fuller longer. Others focus on filling up with extra fruits and vegetables, which leaves less room for unhealthy food. Still others limit variety for most meals and stick with choices that they know are healthy and filling.\nThe details will depend on what you like and what fits in best with your life. If you need ideas and support, talk to a registered dietitian or diabetes educator. Your doctor can give you a referral.\nPhysical activity\nPhysical activity can make you feel better, function better, and sleep better. You're not likely to lose a lot of weight with physical activity alone. But combining it with your diet strategy can improve weight loss. Here are the basic guidelines:\nEvery week\nDo at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking. Or do 75 minutes of vigorous activity, such as jogging. You can also do a combination of the two.\nTwo or more days a week\nDo strength-training activities that involve all major muscle groups, such as lifting weights or using a resistance band.\nIf you have diabetes, physical activity can help you manage the condition along with your weight. Being active makes you more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that helps cells in your body use blood sugar for energy). Your body won't need to make as much insulin or you won't need to take as much. Lower insulin levels can help prevent fat storage and weight gain.\nWillpower isn't enough\nDon't get us wrong: willpower is great. It just isn't enough. You can't count on it to reach and maintain the healthier weight you want.\nBut don't worry; there are other ways. Control your environment so temptation is out of the picture and healthy habits are in. Some ideas:\n- Don't bring home food you don't want to eat. Make home a safe zone!\n- Avoid buffet-style restaurants.\n- Don't let yourself get too hungry.\n- Cook your own food so you can control the calories.\n- Lay out your workout clothes before you go to sleep.\n- Keep the dog's leash and your walking shoes by the door.\nSleep helps\nToo little sleep makes dieting much harder because it increases your hunger and appetite. And what do you want more of? High-calorie, high-carb foods.\nToo little sleep also triggers stress hormones, which tell your body to hang onto fat. Outsmart this problem by being physically active, which can help you fall asleep faster and sleep better.\nA relaxing nighttime routine can also help you get your zzz's. These tips are tried and true:\n- No screens an hour before bedtime.\n- Avoid heavy meals and alcohol before bedtime.\n- Keep your bedroom dark and cool.\nWrite it when you bite it\nWriting down what you eat is the single best predictor of weight loss success. But most people don't do it because they think it will be too time-consuming. Guess how long it takes (yes, studies have been done)? Less than 15 minutes a day on average.\nYou don't need to add lots of detail, but aim for at least 3 entries each day. Do it consistently day after day for the best results.\nFind your \"why\"\nPeople who keep the weight off tend to be motivated by more than just being thinner. For some, it might be a health scare. Others want more energy to play with their grandkids. Focus on a goal that's meaningful to you, and you'll be more likely to keep the pounds off too.\nMore tips\nHigher protein, lower carbs\nEat higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate meals to control hunger and appetite. For people with diabetes who take insulin, eating fewer carbs can lower how much insulin they need. Using less insulin can help prevent hunger, fat storage, and weight gain.\nHigher-fiber carbs\nChoose carbs that are higher in fiber and lower in added sugar. For example, say yes to beans and sweet potatoes. Say no to sugary drinks and chips.\nDrink more water\nDrink more water and fewer sweetened beverages. This one change can cut lots of calories and mean fewer blood sugar swings!\nKeep moving\nPhysical activity helps you stay motivated and keep the weight off.\nLearn from a bad day\nEveryone slips up from time to time. Figure out what went wrong and plan for it next time. You're only human, and humans are great learners.",
            "https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/articles/managing-diabetes-in-the-heat.html": "At a glance\nDid you know that people who have diabetes\u2014either type 1 or type 2\u2014feel the heat more than people who don\u2019t have diabetes? Read on to find out some reasons why.\nHeat affects people with diabetes more\nCertain diabetes complications, such as damage to blood vessels and nerves, can affect your sweat glands so your body can't cool as effectively. That can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which is a medical emergency.\nPeople with diabetes get dehydrated (lose too much water from their bodies) more quickly. Not drinking enough liquids can raise blood sugar, and high blood sugar can make you urinate more, causing dehydration. Some commonly used medicines like diuretics (\"water pills\" to treat high blood pressure) can dehydrate you too.\nHigh temperatures can change how your body uses insulin. You may need to test your blood sugar more often and adjust your insulin dose and what you eat and drink.\nIt's the heat and the humidity\nEven when it doesn't seem very hot outside, the combination of heat and humidity (moisture in the air) can be dangerous. When sweat evaporates (dries) on your skin, it removes heat and cools you. It's harder to stay cool in high humidity because sweat can't evaporate as well.\nWhether you're working out or just hanging out, it's a good idea to check the heat index. The heat index is a measurement that combines temperature and humidity. Take steps to stay cool when it reaches 80\u00b0F in the shade with 40% humidity or above. Important to know: The heat index can be up to 15\u00b0F higher in full sunlight, so stick to the shade when the weather warms up.\nPhysical activity is key to managing diabetes. But don't get active outdoors during the hottest part of the day or when the heat index is high. Get out early in the morning or in the evening when temperatures are lower. Work out at home if you have air-conditioning. Or go to an air-conditioned mall or gym to get active.\nYour blood sugar knows best\nKids out of school, vacations, get-togethers, family reunions. The summer season can throw off your routine, and possibly your diabetes management plan. Check your blood sugar more often to make sure it's in your target range no matter what the summer brings. It's especially important to recognize what low blood sugar feels like and treat it as soon as possible.\nWarm-weather wisdom:\n- Drink plenty of water\u2014even if you're not thirsty\u2014so you don't get dehydrated.\n- Avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine, like coffee, soda, and energy or sports drinks. They can lead to water loss and spike your blood sugar levels.\n- Check your blood sugar before, during, and after you're active. You may need to change how much insulin you use.\n- Wear loose-fitting, lightweight, light-colored clothing.\n- Wear sunscreen and a hat when you're outside. Sunburn can raise your blood sugar levels.\n- Don't go barefoot, even on the beach or at the pool.\n- Use your air conditioner or go to an air-conditioned building or mall to stay cool. In very high heat, a room fan won't cool you enough.\nToo hot to handle\nKnow what else feels the heat? Diabetes medicines, supplies, and equipment.\nDon't store insulin or oral diabetes medicine in direct sunlight or in a hot car. Check package information about how high temperatures can affect insulin and other medicines.\nIf you're traveling, keep insulin and other medicines in a cooler. Don't put insulin directly on ice or on a gel pack.\nHeat can damage your blood sugar monitor, insulin pump, and other diabetes equipment. Don't leave them in a hot car, by a pool, in direct sunlight, or on the beach. The same goes for supplies such as test strips.\nBut don't let the summer heat stop you from taking your diabetes supplies with you when you're out and about. You'll need to be able to test your blood sugar and take steps if it's too high or too low. Just make sure to protect your diabetes gear from the heat.\nStormy weather\nJune 1 marks the beginning of hurricane season. Severe thunderstorms with hail, high winds, and tornadoes are more likely in warm weather too. People with diabetes face extra challenges if the power goes out or they have to seek shelter away from home. Plan how you'll handle medicine that needs refrigeration, such as insulin. And be prepared by packing an emergency go-bag\u2014a supply kit you can grab quickly if you need to leave your home.\nHere's to staying cool, staying safe, and enjoying the long summer days!\nYour summer checklist\n- Drink plenty of water.\n- Test your blood sugar often.\n- Keep medicines, supplies, and equipment out of the heat.\n- Stay inside in air-conditioning when it's hottest.\n- Wear loose, light clothing.\n- Get medical attention for heat-related illness.\n- Make a plan in case you lose power.\n- Have a go-bag ready for emergencies.",

Find out how to adjust your medicines for different time zones and eating schedules, or how to get refills if needed.\nWhile packing, put your diabetes supplies (medicine, blood sugar monitor, etc.) and healthy snacks where you can get to them easily, like in your carry-on bag if you are flying. Pack twice as much medicine as you think you'll need.\nIf you're going through security at the airport there's good news: people with diabetes can bring over 3.4 ounces of liquids through security in their carry-ons. This allows them to travel with liquid medicines, fast-acting sugar sources like juice, or gel packs to keep insulin cool. Finally, be aware that insulin pumps or continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) could be damaged by X-ray machines. Instead of disconnecting your devices, you can ask for a hand inspection.\nWhile you're traveling\nBring healthy foods\nConsider available food options while you travel by car, airplane, or train. If you're driving, bring a cooler with healthy foods and plenty of water. If you're flying, bring options like fruit or nuts so you don't have to resort to unhealthy convenience foods.\nFind healthy options\nSome ideas at airports or roadside restaurants include:\n- Fresh fruit with nuts.\n- Sandwiches on whole wheat bread with grilled chicken or fish.\n- Salad with grilled chicken or fish- limit higher fat toppings such as cheese or creamy dressings.\n- Scrambled or hard boiled eggs.\n- Burgers with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.\n- Fajitas without tortillas and rice.\nPlan medicine and supply storage\nDon't let your medicine and supplies get too hot or too cold. Avoid storing your insulin or other medicines in a hot car, in direct sunlight, or directly on ice. Heat can also damage your blood sugar monitor, insulin pump, and testing strips. Keep your medicines and testing supplies in a cooler with a gel pack. If you're flying, don't keep insulin in a checked bag\u2014it could also get too cold there.\nMove around when you can\nTake breaks from road trips to stretch your legs and walk around. If you're flying or traveling by train, walk up and down the aisles every hour or two to prevent blood clots.\nStay on schedule with medicines\nMany people lose track of time or forget their medicines when they're out of their daily routine. Try setting an alarm on your phone to keep you on track.\nWhen you get there\nCheck your blood sugar often\nCheck regularly to spot any highs or lows from travel. The sooner you discover them, the better you can adjust to get your blood sugar back in your target range. If you're more active or eating less or more than usual, adjust your insulin as instructed by your doctor.\nEnjoy new foods in moderation\nFood can be a big highlight when traveling. You can still enjoy local cuisine but enjoy in moderation. Buffets on cruises can make it easy to eat even when you're not hungry anymore. Moderate your food choices and portion sizes so you don't eat more than you need.\nWatch the heat\nKeep an eye on the temperature if you're traveling somewhere warm. High temperatures, dehydration, and even sunburns can impact your blood sugar.\nDon't forget your feet\nExploring a new place could mean blisters or cuts on your feet. Be sure to check your feet every day, so you can take care of any problems. Avoid walking barefoot, even on the beach.",

This is why it's important to have a diabetes care team that includes specialists from different fields.\nWith your team, you'll develop a diabetes management plan to help you stay healthy. Your plan will also help you prevent or delay diabetes-related complications.\nYou\u2019ll want to find members for your diabetes care team who listen, support, and respect you. This means having a team that uses your preferences, needs, and values to help guide health decisions. You're the most important member of your diabetes care team.\nPrimary care provider (PCP)\nThis doctor is usually your general or family doctor who gives you routine medical care. You'll typically see your PCP for yearly checkups, physical exams, lab tests, and prescriptions.\nEndocrinologist\nThis is a doctor who treats hormone problems. Diabetes affects how your body produces and uses insulin (a hormone).\nYour PCP may want you to see an endocrinologist. An endocrinologist is sometimes the primary doctor who helps you manage diabetes.\nDiabetes care and education specialist\nThis health care professional is trained to provide personalized diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES).

Schedule an eye exam as soon as you're diagnosed with diabetes. This will help your eye doctor monitor any changes to your vision and eye health.\nAn eye doctor could be either an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. Here's the difference:\nAn optometrist provides primary vision care. They can diagnose and treat some eye diseases and disorders, give you an eye exam, and test for vision problems.\nAn ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in eye and vision care. They can diagnose and treat all eye diseases and disorders, prescribe medicine, and perform eye surgery.\nPodiatrist\nThis kind of doctor treats the feet and lower legs. Diabetes can harm the blood vessels and nerves in your legs and feet. This can cause healing problems\u2014a cut or blister can become a hard-to-treat infection. If you notice any sores on your feet or legs, don't wait for your next appointment. See a foot doctor right away.\nAudiologist\nThis doctor specializes in hearing and balance problems. Diabetes can damage small blood vessels and nerves in the inner ear. Have your hearing tested when you first find out you have diabetes. If you think you have hearing loss, ask your PCP for a referral.\nPharmacist\nBesides filling your prescriptions, a pharmacist can tell you which medicines may affect your blood sugar. They can also let you know which shouldn't be used together. This includes over-the-counter and prescription medicines.\nDentist\nA dentist is trained to take care of your teeth and gums. People with diabetes may have a higher risk of gum disease. Make sure to let your dentist know you have diabetes.\nNephrologist\nThis doctor specializes in kidney care. Over time, high blood sugar and high blood pressure from diabetes can damage your kidneys. Your PCP should check your kidneys regularly. If your kidneys don't work as well as they should, your PCP or endocrinologist may send you to a nephrologist.\nMental health professional\nPsychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and counselors can all provide mental health care. They can help you manage the demands of day-to-day diabetes care, as well as mental health issues. If you're concerned about your mental health, ask your doctor to refer you to a mental health professional for help.\nExercise specialist\nThis person is trained in the best and safest ways to get physical activity.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/managing-diabetes": "Managing Diabetes\nOn this page:\n- What are the diabetes ABCs?\n- How can a healthy lifestyle help manage my diabetes?\n- What types of medicines should I take?\n- How can I check my blood glucose level at home?\n- How can I keep track of my progress?\n- What special situations should I plan for?\n- Who should be on my health care team?\n- Clinical Trials for Managing Diabetes\nDiabetes can affect almost every part of your body, including your heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes health problems by leading a healthy lifestyle, taking your medicines, and managing your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar level. Work with your health care team to create a diabetes care plan that works for you.\nWhat are the diabetes ABCs?\nThe diabetes ABCs can help you manage your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. If you smoke, quitting is also important. Managing your ABCs may lower your chances of having health problems from diabetes, such as a heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and foot or leg amputations.\nA is for the A1C blood glucose test\nThe A1C test shows your average blood glucose level over the last 3 months. This test is done at a health care professional\u2019s office or lab. For most people with diabetes, their goal is an A1C level below 7%.1 Your A1C goal may be different if you have other health problems.2 Ask your health care team how often you should have the test and what your goal should be.\nB is for blood pressure\nHigh blood pressure can damage your heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. Some people with diabetes have a blood pressure goal below 130/80 mm Hg.2,3 If you have heart disease or are at high risk for diabetes health problems, your goal may be lower. Ask your health care team what your goal should be.\nC is for cholesterol\nCholesterol is a fat, also called lipid, that is produced by your liver. Unhealthy levels of cholesterol in your blood can build up and clog your blood vessels, which may result in a heart attack or a stroke. Ask your health care team how often you need a cholesterol test, also called a lipid panel, and what your cholesterol level should be. Some people may need to take a medicine called a statin, or another medicine, to lower their cholesterol for heart health.\nS is for stop smoking\nNot smoking is important for your health, especially if you have diabetes. Both smoking and diabetes can make your blood vessels narrow. E-cigarettes aren\u2019t a safe option either. If you smoke, vape, or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help so you don\u2019t have to do it alone.\nHow can a healthy lifestyle help manage my diabetes?\nStaying healthy when you have diabetes can be a challenge. But leading a healthy lifestyle may help keep your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in the ranges recommended by your health care team.\nCreate a healthy meal plan\nYou may worry that having diabetes means going without foods you enjoy. The good news is that you can still eat your favorite foods, but you might need to eat smaller portions or enjoy them less often. Work with your health care team, which may include a registered dietitian or a diabetes educator, to create a meal plan that works for you.\nTalk with your health care team about any challenges you may have finding healthy food. A doctor, registered dietician, diabetes educator, or social worker may be able to recommend resources that can help you. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also provides a list of resources about affording healthy food and finding help from food assistance programs.\nGet physical activity\nPhysical activity may help you lower blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Being active may also help you get better sleep and improve your mood. Try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, each week. If you can, try to do muscle-strengthening activities, such as wall push-ups or seated arm raises, two days a week.4\nReach and maintain a healthy weight\nIf you are overweight or have obesity, ask your health care team how you can manage your weight. To lose weight, you may need to consume fewer calories or get more physical activity. Your health care team may also recommend medicines or surgery to help manage your weight.\nGet enough sleep\nGetting enough sleep may improve your mood, energy level, and blood glucose level. Most adults should aim for about 7 to 8 hours each night.5 Children and adolescents may need more sleep.\nTake care of your mental health\nFeeling stressed, sad, or angry can be common for people with diabetes. Many people with chronic, or long-term, illnesses such as diabetes develop anxiety or other mental health conditions. Learn healthy ways to lower your stress, and ask for help from your health care team or a mental health professional.\nWhat types of medicines should I take?\nTaking diabetes medicines is often part of managing diabetes. The medicines you take depend on your type of diabetes, how well medicines control your blood glucose level, and other health conditions you may have. You may also need medicines to help manage blood pressure or cholesterol levels. Other factors such as medicine costs, insurance coverage, who is providing your diabetes care, and your lifestyle can also affect what medicines you take.\nTake your medicines as they were prescribed, even if you feel good or have reached your blood glucose, blood pressure, or cholesterol goals. Avoid rationing your medicines or skipping taking your medicines if you have trouble paying for them. Talk with your health care team if you can\u2019t afford your medicines or if you experience any side effects.\nHow can I check my blood glucose level at home?\nIf you take insulin or other diabetes medicines, checking your blood glucose level at home may help you avoid high or low blood glucose levels. Even if you do not use insulin, checking your blood glucose level at home can help you manage your diabetes. The test results may help you and your health care team make changes to your meal plan, physical activity level, or diabetes medicines. It may help you understand how certain types of food affect your blood glucose level. You do not get the same level of detail from blood tests\u2014such as the A1C test\u2014that you take at a health care professional\u2019s office.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, your health care team may ask you to check your urine at home for substances called ketones. A large amount of ketones in your urine may mean that you need to manage your diabetes more carefully. Work with your primary health care professional\u2014who may be a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner\u2014to change your diabetes care plan. If high levels of ketones are left untreated, you may develop a dangerous condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.\nDevices to help manage diabetes\nYou can check your blood glucose level at home with a blood glucose meter. The meter tests a drop of your blood, usually from a prick of your fingertip. The meter will show you how much glucose is in your blood at that moment.\nPeople who take insulin to manage their diabetes may benefit from using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). A CGM uses a sensor in the tissue under your skin and shows changes in glucose levels throughout the day and night. Many CGM systems have alarms and warnings that let you know if your glucose level is too low or too high.\nFor safety, you may sometimes need to compare your CGM glucose readings with results from a standard blood glucose meter. This could be needed if you doubt the accuracy of your CGM readings, if you are changing your insulin dose, or if your CGM gives a warning alert.\nSome people use a CGM as part of an artificial pancreas. An artificial pancreas is a system that mimics how a healthy pancreas controls blood glucose in the body. A CGM, an insulin pump, and a software program that shares information between the CGM and insulin pump make up the artificial pancreas.\nAsk your health care team about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it. Make sure to keep a record of your blood glucose self-checks, including the date and time you checked it, the results, and other information, such as what you ate or what physical activity you did that day. You can use a chart or a smartphone app to help you keep track. Take this information with you when you visit your health care team.\nRecommended targets for blood glucose levels\nTalk with your health care team about the blood glucose range that is healthy for you. Be sure to tell your health care team if your glucose levels frequently go above or below your target range.\nMany people with diabetes aim to keep their blood glucose at these levels1\n- Before a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL\n- About 2 hours after a meal starts: less than 180 mg/dL\nYour blood glucose goals may be different if you are an adult over age 65 and have had diabetes for a long time. Your blood glucose goals may also be different if you have other health problems, like heart disease, or if your blood glucose often gets too low.\nIf you use a CGM, your health care team may ask you to keep track of your time in range. Time in range is the percentage of time that your glucose level stays in your target range. For many people with diabetes, the target range is between 70 and 180 mg/dL. Your health care team may adjust your diabetes care plan to help you stay in your target range at least 70% of the time.\nLow blood glucose\nWhen your blood glucose level is too low, it is called hypoglycemia. For most people with diabetes, the blood glucose level is too low when it is below 70 mg/dL.1,2 Talk with your primary care professional or health care team if you often have low blood glucose levels. Some people with low blood glucose experience symptoms such as\n- feeling shaky or jittery\n- headache\n- cold sweat\nIf you often have low blood glucose levels, you may need to change your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or medicines. Very low blood glucose may lead to confusion or fainting, and it can become a serious medical emergency that must be treated right away.\nGlucagon\u2014a hormone that raises blood glucose levels\u2014is the best way to treat severely low blood glucose. Ask your health care team if you need a prescription for glucagon. If you have a glucagon prescription, you should teach your family, friends, and coworkers when and how to give you glucagon in case you are not able to do it yourself.\nHigh blood glucose\nWhen your blood glucose level is too high, it is called hyperglycemia. For most people with diabetes, the blood glucose level is too high when it is above 180 mg/dL. Talk with your health care team if you often have high blood glucose levels. Some people with high blood glucose have symptoms such as\n- feeling tired\n- feeling thirsty\n- having blurry vision\n- urinating too often\nIf you often have high blood glucose levels, you may need to make a change to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or medicines. Very high blood glucose may lead to confusion or fainting, and it may become a serious medical emergency that must be treated right away.\nChecking urine for ketones\nYour health care team may want you to check your urine for ketones if you have symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away.\nSymptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include\n- feeling very tired\n- having trouble breathing\n- having fruity-smelling breath\n- fainting\nMost often, ketoacidosis affects people with type 1 diabetes. However, some people with type 2 diabetes can develop ketoacidosis if they do not produce enough insulin.\nHow can I keep track of my progress?\nYou may find it helpful to keep track of your ABCs and other important health information that you get during checkups with your primary care professional or other health care professionals. Download the Health Checkups Tracker (DOCX, 67.97 KB) , which includes information you may want to track. You can take this information with you when you visit your health care team. Talk with your primary care professional about your goals and whether you need to make any changes to your diabetes care plan.\nWhat special situations should I plan for?\nIf you have diabetes, it is important to take care of your health no matter what is going on in your life. Ask your health care team if you should adjust your meal plan, activity level, or medicines in special situations, such as when you are sick, fasting, at school, planning to travel, or experiencing an emergency or natural disaster.\nWho should be on my health care team?\nYou are the most important member of your health care team, but working with your health care team may help you improve your self-care. Most people with diabetes get help from a primary care professional, such as an internal medicine doctor, family doctor, pediatrician, physician assistant, or certified nurse practitioner trained in diabetes care. Ask your primary care professional about adding other members to your team, including\n- a diabetes educator, nurse, or registered dietitian who can tell you more about your disease and how to improve your self-care\n- a dentist to check for gum diseases and other dental problems\n- an eye doctor to check for diabetic eye disease\n- a pharmacist to help you with your medicines\n- other specialists if you develop health problems such as heart disease, kidney disease, erectile dysfunction, or foot problems\n- a social worker who may be able to help you find financial help for diabetes care and community resources\nWrite a list of questions before your visit with a health care professional so you don\u2019t forget what you want to ask.\nClinical Trials for Managing Diabetes\nNIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for managing diabetes?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of clinical studies\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help health care professionals and researchers learn more about diseases and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of managing diabetes, such as\n- what are the best medicines to add to a diabetes care plan if a person with type 2 diabetes isn\u2019t meeting their blood glucose targets using their current diabetes medicines\n- how to train adolescents to support or care for family members with diabetes\n- how treating obesity with weight-loss medicines or weight-loss surgery, also called metabolic and bariatric surgery, may help manage type 2 diabetes\n- what different devices can help people with diabetes check their blood glucose level and inject insulin\nFind out if clinical trials are right for you.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical trials for managing diabetes are looking for participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on managing diabetes that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at ClinicalTrials.gov. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study.\nWhat have we learned about managing diabetes from NIDDK-funded research?\nThe research funded by NIDDK has improved quality of life for people with diabetes by finding better ways to diagnose and treat the disease.\nArtificial pancreas\nFor decades, NIDDK has supported research that helped create artificial pancreas technology used by some people who need insulin to manage their diabetes.\nNIDDK supported research that helped scientists develop the first continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999. CGMs, which are part of artificial pancreas systems, help people track glucose levels in real-time with fewer finger pricks. Another major milestone came in 2016, when the FDA approved a commercial \u201chybrid\u201d artificial pancreas system. Other artificial pancreas systems have been approved since 2016. NIDDK continues to support research into artificial pancreas systems and other technologies that may improve diabetes management.\nBlood glucose management studies\nNIDDK funded the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The study showed that participants with type 1 diabetes who kept their blood glucose levels close to normal greatly lowered their chances of developing eye, kidney, and nerve disease. A follow-up study, the ongoing Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, has continued to follow DCCT participants since 1994. EDIC has shown that there are long-term benefits of early and intensive blood glucose management on slowing or preventing the development of health problems such as heart, eye, kidney, and nerve diseases. Findings from the DCCT and EDIC studies changed the way diabetes is treated worldwide, and they show that blood glucose control can help people with diabetes lead longer and healthier lives.\nNIDDK also funded the Diabetes & Aging Study to research the effects of early blood glucose management and the development of diabetes health problems in people with type 2 diabetes. The study found that people with less effective diabetes management during the first year after being diagnosed with diabetes had a higher risk of diabetes complications and death.\nThe Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study and a follow-up study, TODAY2, found that type 2 diabetes can be more difficult to treat and manage when it occurs in younger people. The TODAY studies, both funded by NIDDK, show the importance of early, intensive treatment and blood glucose management for children or adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes": "What Is Diabetes?\nDiabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Glucose is your body\u2019s main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food you eat.\nInsulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn\u2019t make enough\u2014or any\u2014insulin, or doesn\u2019t use insulin properly. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn\u2019t reach your cells.\nDiabetes raises the risk for damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. Taking steps to prevent or manage diabetes may lower your risk of developing diabetes health problems.\nWhat are the different types of diabetes?\nThe most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.\nType 2 diabetes\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, the cells in your body don\u2019t use insulin properly. The pancreas may be making insulin but is not making enough insulin to keep your blood glucose level in the normal range. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you have risk factors, such as overweight or obesity, and a family history of the disease. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood.\nYou can help delay or prevent type 2 diabetes by knowing the risk factors and taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle, such as losing weight or preventing weight gain.\nGestational diabetes\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you\u2019ve had gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is type 2 diabetes.\nPrediabetes\nPeople with prediabetes have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. You also have a higher risk for heart disease than people with normal glucose levels.\nOther types of diabetes\nA less common type of diabetes, called monogenic diabetes, is caused by a change in a single gene. Diabetes can also come from having surgery to remove the pancreas, or from damage to the pancreas due to conditions such as cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis.\nHow common are diabetes and prediabetes?\nMore than 133 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes.1\nAs of 2019, 37.3 million people\u2014or 11.3% of the U.S. population\u2014had diabetes.1 More than 1 in 4 people over the age of 65 had diabetes. Nearly 1 in 4 adults with diabetes didn\u2019t know they had the disease.2\nAbout 90% to 95% of diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes.3\nIn 2019, 96 million adults\u201438% of U.S. adults\u2014had prediabetes.4\nWhat other health problems can people with diabetes develop?\nOver time, high blood glucose can damage your heart, kidneys, feet, and eyes. If you have diabetes, you can take steps to lower your chances of developing diabetes health problems by taking steps to improve your health and learning how to manage the disease. Managing your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels can help prevent future health problems.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/at-home-medical-tests/": "What are at-home medical tests?\nAt-home medical tests, also known as home use tests, are kits you can buy online or at your local pharmacy or supermarket. These kits allow you to test for, screen, or monitor certain diseases and conditions in the privacy of your own home. Common at-home tests can include:\n- Pregnancy tests.\n- Blood glucose (blood sugar) tests, which may be used regularly to help you manage your diabetes.\n- Fecal occult blood tests, which screen for colon cancer.\n- Tests that check for signs of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, HIV, and COVID-19.\n- Genetic tests, which may show if you are at higher risk for certain diseases.\nThere are two types of at-home tests:\n- Self-tests involve taking a sample of a body fluid, such as blood, urine, or saliva, and applying it to the kit as directed. These tests provide immediate results.\n- Self-collection tests also allow you to take your sample at home, but then you'll need to package it and mail it to a lab. You can get the results from your health care provider, or you may be able to get them in an online portal with a unique login and password. How long it takes to get your results can vary, based on the type of test.\nMany kits are available without a prescription, but you should still ask your provider for advice on which kits to use.\nOther names: home use tests, home test kits\nHow are they used?\nAt-home testing is frequently used to:\n- Find or screen for disorders, such as high cholesterol or certain infections, before you have any symptoms. This may allow you to get treatment earlier and avoid serious complications. It may also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\n- Help diagnose pregnancy early so you can take steps to care for your health and your baby's by scheduling an appointment with your provider.\n- Monitor chronic diseases, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. This may allow you to make more quickly begin making treatment and/or lifestyle changes to improve your condition.\nHow do I use an at-home test?\nThe specific instructions will vary, depending on the type and brand of the test kit. Below are examples of some common at-home tests and how they are performed.\nPregnancy Test\n- Used to diagnose pregnancy by checking for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is normally only produced during pregnancy.\n- Test procedure:\n- If possible, plan to do the test in the morning. Most pregnancy tests recommend using your first morning urine for more accurate results.\n- You will hold a test strip in your urine stream or collect your urine in a cup and place the test strip into the cup.\n- If you are pregnant, the strip will display a colored line, a double line, or a symbol such as a plus sign. The type of display depends on the brand.\nFollow up with your provider if the test is positive or if the test was negative but you still think you might be pregnant.\nGlucose Test\n- Used to monitor blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. This test is essential for some people with diabetes. If your blood glucose gets too high or too low for you, it can cause dangerous complications.\n- Test procedure:\n- You will prick your finger with a device called a lancet to get a drop of blood.\n- You place the blood on a test strip and insert it into a monitor.\n- The meter will show your glucose level.\n- There are different types of glucose meters, and they work in slightly different ways. Some may not even require you to prick your finger. Be sure to read and follow all the instructions carefully.\nFecal Occult Blood Test\n- Used to check stool for signs of colon cancer. Your provider will give you a test kit.\n- Test procedure:\n- You will collect small stool samples and place them on a special card or container.\n- Seal and mail the card or container to your provider or a lab.\n- The sample will be checked for blood. Blood in the stool can be a sign of colon cancer or other conditions.\n- The testing laboratory or your provider will contact you with the results.\nHepatitis C Test\n- Used to find out if you have hepatitis C now or were infected in the past.\n- Test procedure:\n- You will prick your finger with a device called a lancet to get a drop of blood.\n- You place the blood sample on a special piece of paper.\n- You will seal and mail the paper to a laboratory.\n- The testing laboratory or your provider will contact you with the results.\nGenetic Test\n- Used to find out if you may be at higher risk of cancer or other diseases by looking for certain genetic changes. Genetic tests may also be used to find out information about your ancestors. These tests work by comparing your genetic data with genetic data from large groups of people.\n- Test procedure:\n- You can order many of these tests yourself. Others require a provider's prescription.\n- Most test kits will instruct you to provide a saliva sample or to take a swab from the inside of your cheek.\n- You will mail the sample to the test company or as directed.\n- The testing company or your provider will contact you with the results.\nIf you are using a test to find out your risk of disease, be sure to talk to your provider. These tests can't diagnose diseases and are not as accurate as traditional lab-based genetic tests. But if a home test shows you may be at higher risk, your provider can monitor your health more closely.\nCOVID-19 Test\n- Used to find out if you have COVID-19. A viral test tells if you have a current infection. Viral tests can be either rapid tests, which you can do at home, or laboratory tests.\n- Test procedure:\n- Buy a self-test online or at a store.\n- Most test kits will instruct you to take a nasal swab and swirl it inside your nostril.\n- You will place your sample swab in a vial and then place that in the test unit.\n- You will have results in 30 minutes or less displaying whether you have the COVID-19 virus. The type of display may depend on the brand of the test.\n- Follow the test kit instructions.\nIs there anything else I need to know about at-home medical tests?\nAt-home medical tests can provide helpful information, but they are not a replacement for guidance and treatment by your provider. After at-home testing, you should follow up with your provider regardless of the result.\nIn addition, when purchasing and using an at-home test kit:\n- Only use FDA-approved or FDA-authorized tests. The FDA has strict requirements for the quality and accuracy of home test kits.\n- Follow the test instructions exactly. Even minor changes can affect your results.\n- Don't buy or use expired tests. Chemicals in the test may lose their effectiveness over time.\n- Don't change your medicines because of a test result without talking with your provider. Let your provider know about your results. They can tell you if you need to change your medicine or the dose you take based on your at-home test results.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet].

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/blood-glucose-test/": "What is a blood glucose test?\nA blood glucose test measures the glucose levels in your blood. Glucose is a type of sugar. It is your body's main source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. A hormone called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells for use as energy. If you have too much or too little glucose in your blood, it may be a sign of a serious medical condition.\nHigh blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood glucose levels are higher than what is healthy for you, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin or can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. If blood glucose isn't controlled, it can lead to serious, long-term health conditions, such as heart disease and nerve problems.\nHigh blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood, such as problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands, and side effects from certain medicines.\nLow blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) is often caused by certain diabetes medicines for type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, including insulin. In people without diabetes, low blood glucose is much less common. It may be caused by certain medicines and conditions, such as some kidney or liver diseases. Without treatment, severe low blood glucose can lead to major health problems, including seizures and brain damage.\nSeveral types of blood tests check blood glucose levels. Your health care provider will choose the test that's right for you.\nOther names: blood sugar, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting blood glucose (FBG), random blood sugar, glucose challenge test, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\nWhat is it used for?\nA blood glucose test may be used:\n- As part of a routine checkup to screen for prediabetes and diabetes\n- To help diagnose the cause of symptoms that may mean your blood glucose is too high or too low\n- To monitor the side effects of certain long-term medicines that may affect blood glucose\nWhy do I need a blood glucose test?\nYour provider may order a blood glucose test as part of your routine checkup. Routine blood tests that include a glucose test include a basic metabolic panel (BMP) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).\nThe most common reasons for a blood glucose test are to screen for and monitor prediabetes and diabetes. Your provider may order a blood glucose test if:\n- You have a high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Your risk may be high if you:\n- Are over 35 years old. The American Diabetes Association recommends diabetes screening for prediabetes and diabetes beginning at age 35 years and older.\n- Have prediabetes.\n- Are overweight or have obesity.\n- Have a family history of diabetes.\n- Have high blood pressure or heart disease.\n- Have ever had gestational diabetes (diabetes that develops during pregnancy) or given birth to a baby who weighed over 9 pounds.\n- Exercise less than three times a week.\n- Have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n- Are an African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, or an Alaska Native.\nSome Pacific Islander people and Asian American people also have a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes.\n- You have symptoms of high or low glucose levels, which could mean you have diabetes or another condition that affects blood glucose levels.\nSymptoms of high blood glucose levels include:- Increased thirst\n- Frequent urination (peeing)\n- Blurred vision\n- Fatigue\n- Sores that are slow to heal\n- Losing weight without trying\n- Numbness or tingling in your feet or hands\nSymptoms of low blood glucose levels include:- Feeling shaky or jittery\n- Hunger\n- Fatigue\n- Feeling dizzy, confused, or irritable\n- Headache\n- A fast heartbeat or arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)\n- Having trouble seeing or speaking clearly\n- Fainting or seizures\n- You have prediabetes or diabetes. Your provider may schedule blood glucose tests to monitor your condition. You may also monitor your blood glucose at home.\n- You are pregnant. You will likely have a blood glucose test between the 24th and 28th week of your pregnancy to check for gestational diabetes. If you have a high risk for gestational diabetes, your provider may test you earlier.\n- You take long-term medicines, other than diabetes medicines, that may affect blood glucose levels. Examples of medicines that may cause high blood glucose in some people include certain types of:\nExamples of medicines that may cause low blood glucose in some people include certain types of:\n- ACE inhibitors\n- Antibiotics called quinolones\n- Medicines to treat malaria\nWhat happens during a blood glucose test?\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.\nThere are several types of blood glucose tests:\n- A fasting blood glucose test measures your glucose after you fast (not eating or drinking, except for water) for at least 8 hours. It is often used to:\n- Screen for or monitor prediabetes or diabetes\n- Help diagnose or monitor other conditions that affect blood glucose\n- Check for side effects from medications that can affect blood glucose\n- A random blood glucose test can be done at any time, even after eating. If you have symptoms of diabetes, your provider may use this test first. That's because it can be done right away.\n- A glucose challenge test may be used to screen for gestational diabetes if you are pregnant. You don't need to fast for this test. You will drink a sugary drink that contains glucose. A blood sample is taken one hour later. If your blood glucose is too high, you will usually need an oral glucose tolerance test to confirm or rule out gestational diabetes.\n- An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is used to diagnose gestational diabetes. If you aren't pregnant, it's sometimes used to confirm a diagnosis of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. You will need to fast for this test. A blood sample will be taken before you have a sugary drink. After you have the drink, more blood samples will be taken, usually about every hour for the next 2 or 3 hours.\n- A hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test provides information about your average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. You don't need to fast for this test. It uses one blood sample. An A1C test can diagnose prediabetes and diabetes. Most people with diabetes have an A1C test at least twice a year to check how well they are managing their blood glucose levels.\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nIf your provider orders a fasting blood glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the test. If your glucose test is part of a BMP or CMP test, you may need to fast. Other blood glucose tests don't require any special preparations. Ask your provider whether you need to fast before your glucose test.\nAre there any risks to the test?\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. After an oral glucose tolerance test, you may feel light-headed. Your provider may suggest that you plan to have someone take you home.\nWhat do the results mean?\nThe meaning of your test results will depend on which test you had, the results of other tests, and your medical history. Ask your provider what your test results say about your health.\nIn general:\nIf your results show higher than normal glucose levels, it may mean you have or are at risk for getting diabetes. Prediabetes and diabetes are the most common causes of high glucose levels, but other possible causes include:\n- An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n- A problem with your pancreas, including pancreatitis\n- Stress from surgery, very serious illness, or trauma\n- A problem with your adrenal glands, including Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma\n- Certain medicines\nIf you have diabetes, glucose levels that are lower than normal for you may be caused by:\n- Certain diabetes medicines and other medicines that may lower blood glucose\n- Not eating enough, especially after taking diabetes medicine\n- Being more physically active than usual\nIf you don't have diabetes, low blood glucose levels aren't common. If they happen, they may be caused by:\n- Liver or kidney disease\n- Underactive adrenal glands, for example, Addison disease\n- Certain pituitary disorders\n- An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\n- Malnutrition\n- Certain medicines\n- Alcohol use disorder (AUD)\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nIs there anything else I should know about a blood glucose test?\nIf you have diabetes, you may need to do blood glucose testing at home to help manage your blood glucose levels. Your provider will let you know how often you should test. There are two ways to check your blood glucose. Your provider can help you decide which one is best for you:\n- Blood glucose meters require you to prick your finger with a small device called a lancet. Then, you apply a drop of blood to a test strip and insert it into a small electronic glucose meter, which measures the glucose in your blood.\n- Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) usually use a tiny sensor placed under the skin of your arm or belly. Depending on the type of CGM you use, the sensor stays in place from a week to several months. It automatically estimates your glucose level every few minutes and tracks it so you can see what your blood glucose level is at any time.\nReferences\n- Ahmed FW, Majeed MS, Kirresh O.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/tests-diagnosis": "Diabetes Tests & Diagnosis\nIn this section:\n- Who should be tested for diabetes?\n- What tests are used to diagnose diabetes?\n- What test results tell me if I have diabetes or prediabetes?\n- Which tests help my doctor know what kind of diabetes I have?\nYour doctor can diagnose diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes using blood tests. The blood tests show if your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, is higher than the range that is healthy for you. Blood tests can also help identify the type of diabetes you have.\nDon\u2019t try to diagnose yourself if you think you might have diabetes. Blood testing equipment that you can buy over the counter, such as a blood glucose meter, cannot diagnose diabetes.\nWho should be tested for diabetes?\nAnyone who has symptoms of diabetes should be tested for the disease. Some people will not have any symptoms but may have risk factors for type 2 diabetes and need to be tested. Most pregnant women should also be tested for gestational diabetes. Testing helps doctors find diabetes sooner, so they can work with their patients to manage the disease and prevent health problems.\nIf you have Medicare, it may cover the cost of tests if you have certain risk factors for diabetes. If you have different insurance, ask your insurance company if it covers diabetes tests.\nType 1 diabetes\nDoctors often diagnose type 1 diabetes in children and young adults when they have diabetes symptoms, such as feeling thirsty and having to urinate more often, or if they may have diabetic ketoacidosis. Symptoms in adults may be less specific.1\nType 1 diabetes can run in families. A study called TrialNet offers free testing to relatives of people with type 1 diabetes, even if the relatives don\u2019t have symptoms.\nType 2 diabetes\nExperts recommend routine testing for type 2 diabetes if you have certain risk factors. You may have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you are\n- age 35 or older\n- American Indian, Black or African American, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander\n- overweight or have obesity and have at least one other risk factor\n- a woman who had gestational diabetes\nTake the American Diabetes Association Diabetes Risk Test to see if you are at risk for type 2 diabetes.\nChildren can also develop type 2 diabetes. Experts recommend testing children and teens between the ages of 10 and 18 who are overweight or have obesity and have at least one more risk factor, such as a low birth weight, a parent who had diabetes while pregnant, or another factor.1\nAdults and children with normal diabetes test results should be retested every 3 years.1\nIf your blood glucose levels are higher than the target range, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes, doctors will diagnose you with prediabetes. Having prediabetes is serious because it raises the chance of developing type 2 diabetes. But developing type 2 diabetes can be prevented. Adults and children diagnosed with prediabetes should be tested for type 2 diabetes every year.\nTesting for type 2 diabetes before and during pregnancy\nAll women who are planning to get pregnant should be tested for type 2 diabetes, especially if they have risk factors.\nIf you are already pregnant, you should be tested for type 2 diabetes at the first prenatal appointment, or in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. If you have diabetes, you should receive special care during your pregnancy to avoid problems for you and the baby.\nGestational diabetes\nAll pregnant women who do not have a previous diagnosis of diabetes should be tested for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.1\nIf you have gestational diabetes, you should get tested after your baby is born to see if you have type 2 diabetes, usually within 12 weeks after delivery.\nWhat tests are used to diagnose diabetes?\nDoctors use a variety of tests to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes. Your doctor may recommend different tests depending on whether you have symptoms or not, or whether you are pregnant.\nFasting plasma glucose test\nThe fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test measures your blood glucose level at a single point in time. For the most reliable results, your doctor will give you the test in the morning after you have fasted for at least 8 hours. Fasting means having nothing to eat or drink except sips of water.\nA1C test\nThe A1C test is a blood test that provides your average levels of blood glucose over the last 3 months. Other names for the A1C test are hemoglobin A1C, HbA1C, glycated hemoglobin, and glycosylated hemoglobin test. You can eat and drink before this test. Before using the A1C test to diagnose diabetes, your doctor will consider factors, such as whether you are in your second or third trimester of pregnancy or whether you have certain types of anemia or another problem with your blood.1 The A1C test might not be accurate in those cases.\nCertain types of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin variants, can interfere with measuring A1C levels. Most A1C tests used in the United States are not affected by the most common variants. If your A1C test results and blood glucose levels do not match, your doctor should consider that the A1C test may not be a reliable test for you.\nYour doctor will report your A1C test result as a percentage, such as an A1C of 7%. The higher the percentage is, the higher your average blood glucose levels are.\nRandom plasma glucose test\nSometimes doctors use the random plasma glucose test to diagnose diabetes when you have symptoms of diabetes and they do not want to wait until you have fasted for 8 hours. You may have this blood test at any time.\nGlucose challenge test\nIf you are pregnant, your doctor might test you for gestational diabetes with the glucose challenge test. Another name for this test is the glucose screening test. In this test, a health care professional will take a sample of your blood 1 hour after you drink a sweet liquid containing glucose. You do not need to fast for this test. If your blood glucose level is too high\u2014135 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL or higher\u2014you may need to return for an oral glucose tolerance test while fasting.\nOral glucose tolerance test\nThe oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) helps doctors detect type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes. However, the OGTT is a more expensive test than the FPG test and the glucose challenge test, and it is not as easy to give.\nBefore the test, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours. A health care professional will take a blood sample to measure your glucose level after fasting. Next, you will drink a liquid that is high in sugar. Another blood sample is taken 2 hours later to check your blood glucose level. If your blood glucose level is high, you may have diabetes.\nIf you are pregnant, your blood will be drawn every hour for 2 to 3 hours. If your blood glucose levels are high two or more times during the OGTT, you may have gestational diabetes.\nWhat test results tell me if I have diabetes or prediabetes?\nEach test to detect diabetes and prediabetes uses a different measurement. Usually, your doctor will use a second test to confirm you have diabetes.\nThe table below helps you understand what your test results mean if you are not pregnant.1 If you are pregnant, some tests use different cutoffs. Ask your doctor what your test results mean.\nTest results for diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes\n| Diagnosis | A1C | Fasting Plasma Glucose | Oral Glucose Tolerance Test* | Random Plasma Glucose Test\u2021 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Normal | below 5.7% | 99 mg/dL or below | 139 mg/dL or below | N/A |\n| Prediabetes | 5.7% to 6.4% | 100 to 125 mg/dL | 140 to 199 mg/dL | N/A |\n| Diabetes | 6.5% or above | 126 mg/dL or above | 200 mg/dL or above | 200 mg/dL or above |\nWhich tests help my doctor know what kind of diabetes I have?\nEven though the tests described above can confirm you have diabetes, they can\u2019t identify what type you have\u2014type 1, type 2, or a rare type of diabetes called monogenic diabetes. Treatment can depend on the type of diabetes you have, so knowing which type you have is important.\nGenetic testing\nGenetic testing can diagnose most forms of monogenic diabetes, which is caused by a change\u2014or mutation\u2014in a gene. Anyone can have monogenic diabetes, but it is more common in babies who develop diabetes before they are 6 months old, some teens, and some young adults.\nAutoantibodies\nIf you have diabetes, your doctor may look for certain autoantibodies to see if your diabetes is type 1. Autoantibodies are proteins in your immune system that mistakenly attack your healthy tissues and cells. A health care professional will take a sample of your blood for this test. If autoantibodies for diabetes are found in your blood, you may have type 1 diabetes.1\nIf you do not have diabetes but your parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes, your doctor might give you this test to see if you have a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes. You may want to learn about diabetes symptoms and have follow-up testing as recommended by your doctor.1\nReference\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glucagon-blood-test/": "What is a glucagon blood test?\nThis test measures the amount of glucagon in your blood. Glucagon is a hormone made by your pancreas. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs. Glucagon works with other hormones, like insulin, to help maintain your body's level of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Glucagon increases your blood glucose levels, while insulin decreases your blood glucose levels.\nGlucose is your body's main source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. This causes your blood glucose levels to go up, and less glucagon is released.\nAnd when your blood glucose levels drop, your pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream. But if your pancreas doesn't release the right amount of glucagon, it can lead to serious health problems.\nOther names: glucagon blood test, hypoglycemia-glucagon test, glucagon-plasma\nWhat is it used for?\nA glucagon test is most often used to help diagnose the following conditions:\n- Hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose, occurs when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you. Severe hypoglycemia can be deadly if it's not treated. The condition often affects people with diabetes. It can happen when your diabetes medicines and/or food intake are not at the proper levels.\n- Pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. It can be acute (sudden and short term) or chronic (long term). The systoms of acute pancreatitis are severe and may require immediate medical attention. Chronic pancreatitis gets worse over time and can lead to permanent damage. It symptoms may not appear until there are complications.\n- Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas. It is usually cancerous.\nThe test is also sometimes used to monitor people with diabetes.\nWhy do I need a glucagon blood test?\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of hypoglycemia or a pancreatic tumor.\nSymptoms of hypoglycemia can include:\n- Fast or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n- Tingling in the lips, tongue, or cheeks\n- Anxiety\n- Irritability\n- Sweating\n- Blurred vision\n- Fatigue\n- Pale skin\n- Hunger\nSymptoms of a pancreatic tumor can include:\nWhat happens during a glucagon blood test?\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nYou may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.\nAre there any risks to the test?\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\nWhat do the results mean?\nIf your glucagon levels were not in the normal range, it may be a sign of one of the following conditions:\n- Hypoglycemia\n- Diabetes\n- Acute or chronic pancreatitis\n- Glucagonoma (pancreatic tumor)\nIf you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nIs there anything else I need to know about a glucagon blood test?\nA glucagon blood test and a glucagon stimulation test are often called glucagon tests, but they are not the same thing. A glucagon blood test is used to check conditions related to glucose levels, while a glucagon stimulation test checks for problems with growth hormones. It is most often used for infants and children.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995-2024.

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/glucose-in-urine-test/": "What is a glucose in urine test?\nA glucose in urine test measures the amount of glucose in your urine (pee). Glucose is a type of sugar. It is your body's main source of energy. Glucose comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. Your blood carries glucose to your cells for energy.\nNormally, urine contains very little or no glucose. That's because your kidneys hold on to glucose and send it back to your bloodstream instead of flushing it out of your body in urine. If you have more glucose than normal in your urine, it could mean that you have:\n- Too much glucose in your blood, which could be a sign of diabetes. Diabetes is the most common cause of high urine glucose levels.\n- A rare kidney condition that causes your kidneys to remove glucose from your blood even when your blood glucose levels are normal. These conditions include:\n- Renal glycosuria, a genetic condition that is inherited (passed down through families)\n- Fanconi syndrome, a genetic condition you can inherit or develop later in life (Fanconi syndrome is not related to Fanconi anemia)\nIf your urine glucose levels are high, your health care provider will usually order a blood glucose test to help make a diagnosis.\nOther names: urine sugar test; urine glucose test; glucosuria test; glycosuria test\nWhat is it used for?\nA glucose in urine test is usually part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and other substances in your urine. A urinalysis is often used to check your general health.\nIn the past, urine glucose testing was commonly used to screen for and monitor diabetes. But urine glucose testing is not as accurate as blood glucose testing, so blood tests are now more commonly used to diagnose and monitor diabetes.\nA urine glucose test may still be used to help diagnose and monitor diabetes if you have a condition that makes blood testing difficult. For example, you may not be able to have a blood test if your veins are scarred from past blood tests or if you have a type of bacterial infection that could spread to your blood if a needle is inserted into a vein.\nA glucose in urine test may also be done if your provider thinks you could have an uncommon type of kidney disorder.\nWhy do I need a glucose in urine test?\nYou may have a glucose in urine test as part of your routine checkup. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of diabetes or need to monitor your diabetes, but you are unable to have a blood glucose test.\nSymptoms of diabetes include:\n- Increased thirst and urination\n- Increased hunger\n- Fatigue\n- Blurred vision\n- Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet\n- Sores that don't heal\n- Losing weight without trying\nIf you are pregnant, you will likely have a glucose in urine test as part of a urinalysis to check your health. Some glucose in urine is common during pregnancy. But high levels over time could be a sign of gestational diabetes, which is a type of diabetes that happens only during pregnancy.\nYou may need a glucose in urine test if your provider thinks you could have an uncommon kidney problem that affects how your kidneys filter glucose in blood. These conditions don't always cause symptoms. Your provider may want to test you because you have a family history of one of these conditions.\nWhat happens during a glucose in urine test?\nYou will need to give a urine sample for the test. A health care professional may give you a cleansing wipe, a small container, and instructions for how to use the \"clean catch\" method to collect your urine sample. It's important to follow these instructions so that germs from your skin don't get into the sample:\n- Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them.\n- Open the container without touching the inside.\n- Clean your genital area with the cleansing wipe:\n- For a penis, wipe the entire head (end) of the penis. If you have a foreskin, pull it back first.\n- For a vagina, separate the labia (the folds of skin around the vagina) and wipe the inner sides from front to back.\n- Urinate into the toilet for a few seconds and then stop the flow. Start urinating again, this time into the container. Don't let the container touch your body.\n- Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container should have markings to show how much urine is needed.\n- Finish urinating into the toilet.\n- Put the cap on the container and return it as instructed.\nIf you have hemorrhoids that bleed or are having your menstrual period, tell your provider before your test.\nYour provider may ask you to monitor your urine glucose at home with a test kit. Your home test kit will come with a package of strips for testing a sample of your urine and instructions on how to do the test. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Talk with your provider about what time of day you should test your urine to get the most accurate results.\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nYou usually don't need any special preparations for this test. Some medicines and supplements may affect your test results, so be sure to tell your provider about everything you're taking. But don't stop taking any medicine without talking with your provider first.\nAre there any risks to the test?\nThere is no known risk to having a glucose in urine test.\nWhat do the results mean?\nIf your test result is normal, it means that you had little to no glucose in your urine. But this doesn't mean that you don't have diabetes. You can have a normal urine glucose level when your blood glucose level is high.\nIf your test result shows you have too much glucose in your urine, it may be a sign of:\n- Diabetes (If you have already been diagnosed with diabetes, high urine glucose may mean that your diabetes is not well controlled)\n- Pregnancy\n- Gestational diabetes\n- An uncommon type of kidney disorder\nA urine glucose test alone cannot diagnose any conditions. So, if you have an abnormal test result, your provider may order other tests to help make a diagnosis, including blood tests to diagnose or rule out diabetes.\nToo much urine glucose doesn't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Certain medicines, vitamin C, and eating a large meal may affect your test results. Ask your provider what your test results mean and whether you need a blood glucose test for more accurate results.\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet].

            "https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/ketones-in-blood/": "What is a ketones in blood test?\nA ketones in blood test measures the level of ketones in your blood. Ketones are acids that your body makes when it breaks down fat for energy.\nNormally, the cells in your body use blood glucose (sugar) for energy. You get glucose from eating carbohydrates. If your cells can't get enough glucose, your body will break down fat for energy instead. This process produces ketones. If your body breaks down fat too fast, ketones can build up in your blood and urine.\nHigh ketone levels make your blood too acidic. This is a serious condition called ketoacidosis. The most common type of ketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a medical emergency that often develops quickly and can lead to a coma and be life-threatening.\nIf you have diabetes, a ketones in blood test can help find high ketone levels early so you can get treatment right away. If your health care provider recommends frequent testing to check for increasing ketone levels, at-home blood testing meters are available that check both glucose levels and ketones. At-home testing for ketones in urine testing may also be an option. Talk with your provider about which is right for you.\nOther names: Ketone bodies (blood), serum ketones, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetate, nitroprusside test\nWhat is it used for?\nWith diabetes:\nA ketones in blood test is mostly used to check for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in people with diabetes. DKA can affect anyone with diabetes, but it is most common with type 1 diabetes. With type 2 diabetes, DKA is less common.\nIf you have diabetes, a blood ketones test may be used when you are sick or pregnant. You may also be tested if you develop diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes).\nIf you don't have diabetes, you may have your blood ketones checked if you are at risk for developing ketoacidosis and you have symptoms. You are at risk for ketoacidosis if you have a condition that causes your body to use fat for energy instead of glucose, such as:\n- An eating disorder\n- Frequent vomiting or diarrhea\n- Alcohol use disorder\nWhy do I need a ketones in blood test?\nYou may need a ketones in blood test if you have diabetes and symptoms of DKA, such as:\n- Feeling very thirsty\n- Urinating (peeing) a lot more than usual\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Abdominal (belly) pain\n- Dry skin and mouth\n- Fast, deep breathing\n- Breath that has a fruity smell\n- Headache\n- Muscle stiffness or aches\n- Fatigue\n- Confusion\nIf you don't have diabetes, you may need a ketones in blood test if you have symptoms of ketoacidosis that could be from another condition. You may also need the test if you have symptoms, and you eat a low-carbohydrate \"keto\" diet for weight loss.\nWhat happens during a ketones in blood test?\nA health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.\nTo check blood ketones at home, you may use a blood glucose meter that also tests for ketones. You will use a device to prick your finger. You'll collect a drop of blood on a ketone test strip that is inserted into the meter. The meter will show your ketone levels. Follow the instructions carefully. You can also test for ketones in urine using an at-home kit. Ask your provider how you should test for ketones, when you should test, and what to do if your levels are high.\nWill I need to do anything to prepare for the test?\nYou don't need any special preparations for a ketones in blood test.\nAre there any risks to the test?\nThere is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.\nWhat do the results mean?\nA normal or negative test result usually means that your body is not making too many ketones and you don't have ketoacidosis. But a normal test result doesn't always rule out diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). That's because your body makes three types of ketones. If DKA is in the early stages, only one type of ketone will be high, and lab tests often don't measure this type of ketone.\nA high or positive test result means you have ketones in your blood. It's normal to have some blood ketones, but if your levels are very high and you have symptoms, you may have ketoacidosis. If you have diabetes, you likely have DKA. If you don't have diabetes, you may have ketoacidosis from alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, not eating for very long periods of time, or other conditions.\nKetoacidosis from any cause must be treated. Treatment may include going to the hospital.\nIf you have questions about your results, talk with your provider.\nLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.\nIs there anything else I need to know about a ketones in blood test?\nPeople who eat a low-carbohydrate keto diet to lose weight will have blood ketone levels that are higher, but are not high enough to be ketoacidosis. This condition is called ketosis.\nKetosis doesn't make your blood too acidic because your body is able to use the ketones, so they don't build up. But it's possible to develop ketoacidosis on a keto diet, so it's important to talk with your provider to see if it's safe for you.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet].

At-home urine tests are easy to do and can provide accurate results as long as you carefully follow all the instructions.\nSome people use at-home kits to test for ketones if they are on a ketogenic or \"keto\" diet to try to lose weight. On a keto diet, you eat mainly foods with little or no carbohydrates. This makes your body use fat instead of glucose for energy, which may increase your ketone levels. A keto diet may not be right for people with certain conditions. Talk with your provider before going on a keto diet to see if it is right for you.\nReferences\n- American Diabetes Association [Internet]. Arlington (VA): American Diabetes Association; c1995-2024.

Adapted from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\nA1C\nA test that measures a person's average blood glucose (blood sugar) level over the past two to three months. Hemoglobin (HEE-mo-glo-bin) is the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen to the cells and sometimes joins with the glucose in the bloodstream. Also called hemoglobin A1C or glycosylated (gly-KOH-sih-lay-ted) hemoglobin, the test shows the amount of glucose that sticks to the red blood cell, which is proportional to the amount of glucose in the blood.\nAcanthosis nigricans (uh-kan-THO-sis NIH-grih-kans)\nA skin condition characterized by darkened skin patches; common in people whose body is not responding correctly to the insulin that they make in their pancreas (insulin resistance). This skin condition is also seen in people who have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.\nAcute\nDescribes something that happens suddenly and for a short time. Opposite of chronic.\nAdhesive capsulitis (ad-HEE-sive cap-soo-LITE-is) (also commonly known as \u201cfrozen shoulder\u201d)\nA condition of the shoulder associated with diabetes that results in pain and loss of the ability to move the shoulder.\nAdult-onset diabetes\nFormer term for type 2 diabetes.\nAGEs (A-G-EEZ)\nStands for advanced glycosylation (gly-KOH-sih-LAY-shun) end products. AGEs are produced in the body when glucose links with protein. They play a role in damaging blood vessels, which can lead to diabetes complications.\nAlbuminuria (al-BYOO-mih-NOO-ree-uh)\nA condition in which the urine has more than normal amounts of a protein called albumin. Albuminuria may be a sign of nephropathy (kidney disease).\nAlpha cell (AL-fa)\nA type of cell in the pancreas. Alpha cells make and release a hormone called glucagon. The body sends a signal to the alpha cells to make glucagon when blood glucose (blood sugar) falls too low. Then glucagon reaches the liver where it tells it to release glucose into the blood for energy.\nAmylin (AM-ih-lin)\nA hormone formed by beta cells in the pancreas. Amylin regulates the timing of glucose release into the bloodstream after eating by slowing the emptying of the stomach.\nAmyotrophy (a-my-AH-truh-fee)\nA type of neuropathy resulting in pain, weakness and/or wasting in the muscles.\nAnemia (uh-NEE-mee-uh)\nA condition in which the number of red blood cells is less than normal, resulting in less oxygen being carried to the body's cells.\nAngiopathy (an-gee-AH-puh-thee)\nAny disease of the blood vessels (veins, arteries, capillaries) or lymphatic vessels.\nAntibodies (AN-ti-bod-eez)\nProteins made by the body to protect itself from \"foreign\" substances such as bacteria or viruses.

This lack of fluid keeps your body from working properly and can be caused from frequent urinating, sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting.\nDesensitization (dee-sens-ih-tiz-A-shun)\nReducing response such as an allergic reaction to something. For example, if someone has diabetes and has frequent low blood glucose (blood sugar) levels (hypoglycemia) the body may not react with the same symptoms that would signal that there\u2019s a problem.\nDiabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\nA study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, conducted from 1983 to 1993 in people with type 1 diabetes. The study showed that intensive therapy compared to conventional therapy significantly helped prevent or delay diabetes complications. Intensive therapy included multiple daily insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump with multiple blood glucose (blood sugar) readings each day.

            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444#main-content": "Overview\nDiabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.\nThe main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.\nChronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.\nProducts & Services\nSymptoms\nDiabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. Some people, especially if they have prediabetes, gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.\nSome of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are:\n- Feeling more thirsty than usual.\n- Urinating often.\n- Losing weight without trying.\n- Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin.\n- Feeling tired and weak.\n- Feeling irritable or having other mood changes.\n- Having blurry vision.\n- Having slow-healing sores.\n- Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.\nType 1 diabetes can start at any age. But it often starts during childhood or teen years. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40. But type 2 diabetes in children is increasing.\nWhen to see a doctor\n- If you think you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your health care provider. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.\n- If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize.\nCauses\nTo understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose.\nHow insulin works\nInsulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas).\n- The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream.\n- The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells.\n- Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.\n- As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.\nThe role of glucose\nGlucose \u2014 a sugar \u2014 is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.\n- Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.\n- Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\n- The liver stores and makes glucose.\n- When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps your glucose level within a typical range.\nThe exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. It is unclear what those factors may be.\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Family history may play a part in all types. Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes.\nSometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.\nRace or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, certain people \u2014 including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people \u2014 are at higher risk.\nPrediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are more common in people who are overweight or obese.\nComplications\nLong-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes \u2014 and the less controlled your blood sugar \u2014 the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. In fact, prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes. Possible complications include:\n- Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems. These can include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke.\n-\nNerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.\nDamage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction.\n- Kidney damage from diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). The kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system.\n- Eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye. This could lead to blindness.\n- Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications.\n- Skin and mouth conditions. Diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.\n- Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.\n- Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease.\n- Depression related to diabetes. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nComplications of gestational diabetes\nMost women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby.\nComplications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes, including:\n- Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta. Extra glucose triggers the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large. It can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a C-section.\n- Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. This is because their own insulin production is high.\n- Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\n- Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.\nComplications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes, including:\n- Preeclampsia. Symptoms of this condition include high blood pressure, too much protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet.\n- Gestational diabetes. If you had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy.\nPrevention\nType 1 diabetes can't be prevented. But the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them:\n- Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Eat a variety to keep from feeling bored.\n- Get more physical activity. Try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week. Or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. For example, take a brisk daily walk. If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day.\n-\nLose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms), losing 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) can lower the risk of diabetes.\nBut don't try to lose weight during pregnancy. Talk to your provider about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy.\nTo keep your weight in a healthy range, work on long-term changes to your eating and exercise habits. Remember the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and higher self-esteem.\nSometimes drugs are an option. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. But healthy lifestyle choices are important. If you have prediabetes, have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to make sure you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.",

            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444": "Overview\nDiabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.\nThe main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.\nChronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.\nProducts & Services\nSymptoms\nDiabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. Some people, especially if they have prediabetes, gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.\nSome of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are:\n- Feeling more thirsty than usual.\n- Urinating often.\n- Losing weight without trying.\n- Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin.\n- Feeling tired and weak.\n- Feeling irritable or having other mood changes.\n- Having blurry vision.\n- Having slow-healing sores.\n- Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.\nType 1 diabetes can start at any age. But it often starts during childhood or teen years. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40. But type 2 diabetes in children is increasing.\nWhen to see a doctor\n- If you think you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your health care provider. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.\n- If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize.\nCauses\nTo understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose.\nHow insulin works\nInsulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas).\n- The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream.\n- The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells.\n- Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.\n- As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.\nThe role of glucose\nGlucose \u2014 a sugar \u2014 is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.\n- Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.\n- Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\n- The liver stores and makes glucose.\n- When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps your glucose level within a typical range.\nThe exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. It is unclear what those factors may be.\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Family history may play a part in all types. Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes.\nSometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.\nRace or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, certain people \u2014 including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people \u2014 are at higher risk.\nPrediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are more common in people who are overweight or obese.\nComplications\nLong-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes \u2014 and the less controlled your blood sugar \u2014 the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. In fact, prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes. Possible complications include:\n- Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems. These can include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke.\n-\nNerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.\nDamage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction.\n- Kidney damage from diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). The kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system.\n- Eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye. This could lead to blindness.\n- Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications.\n- Skin and mouth conditions. Diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.\n- Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.\n- Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease.\n- Depression related to diabetes. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nComplications of gestational diabetes\nMost women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby.\nComplications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes, including:\n- Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta. Extra glucose triggers the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large. It can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a C-section.\n- Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. This is because their own insulin production is high.\n- Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\n- Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.\nComplications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes, including:\n- Preeclampsia. Symptoms of this condition include high blood pressure, too much protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet.\n- Gestational diabetes. If you had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy.\nPrevention\nType 1 diabetes can't be prevented. But the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them:\n- Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Eat a variety to keep from feeling bored.\n- Get more physical activity. Try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week. Or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. For example, take a brisk daily walk. If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day.\n-\nLose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms), losing 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) can lower the risk of diabetes.\nBut don't try to lose weight during pregnancy. Talk to your provider about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy.\nTo keep your weight in a healthy range, work on long-term changes to your eating and exercise habits. Remember the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and higher self-esteem.\nSometimes drugs are an option. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. But healthy lifestyle choices are important. If you have prediabetes, have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to make sure you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.",
            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451": "Diagnosis\nType 1 diabetes FAQs\nEndocrinologist Yogish Kudva, M.B.B.S., answers the most frequently asked questions about type 1 diabetes.\nHi, I'm Dr. Yogish C Kudva. I'm an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic and I'm here to answer some of the important questions you may have about type one diabetes.\nThe best current treatment for type one diabetes is an automated insulin delivery system. This system includes a continuous glucose monitor, insulin pump, and a computer algorithm that continually adjusts insulin responding to the continuous glucose monitoring signal. The patient still has to enter information about the amount of carbohydrate he or she eats at mealtimes to provide the meal time related insulin.\nTesting using a glucose meter is not enough because glucose measurements in people with type one diabetes, vary from normal to low and normal to high very rapidly in the course of a day, a continuous glucose monitor is needed to assess whether treatment is effective and also to determine how to improve treatment.\nCurrent guidelines recommend use of a continuous glucose monitor. The percentage of time that is spent daily with glucose between 70 and 180 milligram per deciliter is the main measurement of appropriate treatment. This percentage should be 70% or higher daily. In addition, percentage of time spent with glucose below 70 should be less than four percent and greater than 250 should be less than five percent. Clearly, hemoglobin A1C testing to evaluate adequacy of treatment is not enough.\nIn certain people with type one diabetes transplantation can be undertaken. This could be pancreas transplantation or transplantation of insulin making cells called islet. Islet transplantation is considered research in the US. Pancreas transplantation is available as a clinical treatment. These patients with hypoglycemia unawareness may benefit from a pancreas transplant. People with type one diabetes who develop recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis may also benefit from a pancreas transplant. People with type one diabetes who have developed kidney failure, could have their lives transformed by transplantation of both the pancreas and the kidney.\nThere is active research going on to prevent type one diabetes from happening in children and adults who are less than 45 years old. People who are eligible for such research studies are people who have a positive antibody test for type one diabetes and are willing to be in such studies. The treatment being tested is medication that suppresses the immune system. Willing participants would be randomized to receive immune suppressive treatment or placebo treatment. Placebo looks like the medication, but does not do the same thing in the body. Initial research studies have been successful in decreasing the risk of development of type one diabetes in people that have received the immune system suppressing treatment and therefore, larger studies are now being undertaken.\nTry to be informed about research going on and treatments that may be approved for type one diabetes. You can get this information through already available publications. Make sure that at least annually you see a physician who is an expert on your disorder. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish well.\nType 1 diabetes symptoms often start suddenly and are often the reason for checking blood sugar levels. Because symptoms of other types of diabetes and prediabetes come on more gradually or may not be easy to see, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has developed screening guidelines. The ADA recommends that the following people be screened for diabetes:\n- Anyone with a body mass index higher than 25 (23 for Asian Americans), regardless of age, who has additional risk factors. These factors include high blood pressure, non-typical cholesterol levels, an inactive lifestyle, a history of polycystic ovary syndrome or heart disease, and having a close relative with diabetes.\n- Anyone older than age 35 is advised to get an initial blood sugar screening. If the results are normal, they should be screened every three years after that.\n- Women who have had gestational diabetes are advised to be screened for diabetes every three years.\n- Anyone who has been diagnosed with prediabetes is advised to be tested every year.\n- Anyone who has HIV is advised to be tested.\nTests for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and prediabetes\n-\nA1C test. This blood test, which doesn't require not eating for a period of time (fasting), shows your average blood sugar level for the past 2 to 3 months. It measures the percentage of blood sugar attached to hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. It's also called a glycated hemoglobin test.\nThe higher your blood sugar levels, the more hemoglobin you'll have with sugar attached. An A1C level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests means that you have diabetes. An A1C between 5.7% and 6.4% means that you have prediabetes. Below 5.7% is considered normal.\n- Random blood sugar test. A blood sample will be taken at a random time. No matter when you last ate, a blood sugar level of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) \u2014 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) \u2014 or higher suggests diabetes.\n- Fasting blood sugar test. A blood sample will be taken after you haven't eaten anything the night before (fast). A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.\n-\nGlucose tolerance test. For this test, you fast overnight. Then, the fasting blood sugar level is measured. Then you drink a sugary liquid, and blood sugar levels are tested regularly for the next two hours.\nA blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal. A reading of more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after two hours means you have diabetes. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L) means you have prediabetes.\nIf your provider thinks you may have type 1 diabetes, they may test your urine to look for the presence of ketones. Ketones are a byproduct produced when muscle and fat are used for energy. Your provider will also probably run a test to see if you have the destructive immune system cells associated with type 1 diabetes called autoantibodies.\nYour provider will likely see if you're at high risk for gestational diabetes early in your pregnancy. If you're at high risk, your provider may test for diabetes at your first prenatal visit. If you're at average risk, you'll probably be screened sometime during your second trimester.\nTreatment\nDepending on what type of diabetes you have, blood sugar monitoring, insulin and oral drugs may be part of your treatment. Eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight and getting regular physical activity also are important parts of managing diabetes.\nTreatments for all types of diabetes\nAn important part of managing diabetes \u2014 as well as your overall health \u2014 is keeping a healthy weight through a healthy diet and exercise plan:\n-\nHealthy eating. Your diabetes diet is simply a healthy-eating plan that will help you control your blood sugar. You'll need to focus your diet on more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains. These are foods that are high in nutrition and fiber and low in fat and calories. You'll also cut down on saturated fats, refined carbohydrates and sweets. In fact, it's the best eating plan for the entire family. Sugary foods are OK once in a while. They must be counted as part of your meal plan.\nUnderstanding what and how much to eat can be a challenge. A registered dietitian can help you create a meal plan that fits your health goals, food preferences and lifestyle. This will likely include carbohydrate counting, especially if you have type 1 diabetes or use insulin as part of your treatment.\n-\nPhysical activity. Everyone needs regular aerobic activity. This includes people who have diabetes. Physical activity lowers your blood sugar level by moving sugar into your cells, where it's used for energy. Physical activity also makes your body more sensitive to insulin. That means your body needs less insulin to transport sugar to your cells.\nGet your provider's OK to exercise. Then choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming or biking. What's most important is making physical activity part of your daily routine.\nAim for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes.\nTreatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes\nTreatment for type 1 diabetes involves insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump, frequent blood sugar checks, and carbohydrate counting. For some people with type 1 diabetes, pancreas transplant or islet cell transplant may be an option.\nTreatment of type 2 diabetes mostly involves lifestyle changes, monitoring of your blood sugar, along with oral diabetes drugs, insulin or both.\nMonitoring your blood sugar\nDepending on your treatment plan, you may check and record your blood sugar as many as four times a day or more often if you're taking insulin. Careful blood sugar testing is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range. People with type 2 diabetes who aren't taking insulin generally check their blood sugar much less often.\nPeople who receive insulin therapy also may choose to monitor their blood sugar levels with a continuous glucose monitor. Although this technology hasn't yet completely replaced the glucose meter, it can lower the number of fingersticks necessary to check blood sugar and provide important information about trends in blood sugar levels.\nEven with careful management, blood sugar levels can sometimes change unpredictably. With help from your diabetes treatment team, you'll learn how your blood sugar level changes in response to food, physical activity, medications, illness, alcohol and stress. For women, you'll learn how your blood sugar level changes in response to changes in hormone levels.\nBesides daily blood sugar monitoring, your provider will likely recommend regular A1C testing to measure your average blood sugar level for the past 2 to 3 months.\nCompared with repeated daily blood sugar tests, A1C testing shows better how well your diabetes treatment plan is working overall. A higher A1C level may signal the need for a change in your oral drugs, insulin regimen or meal plan.\nYour target A1C goal may vary depending on your age and various other factors, such as other medical conditions you may have or your ability to feel when your blood sugar is low. However, for most people with diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C of below 7%. Ask your provider what your A1C target is.\nInsulin\nPeople with type 1 diabetes must use insulin to manage blood sugar to survive. Many people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes also need insulin therapy.\nMany types of insulin are available, including short-acting (regular insulin), rapid-acting insulin, long-acting insulin and intermediate options. Depending on your needs, your provider may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use during the day and night.\nInsulin can't be taken orally to lower blood sugar because stomach enzymes interfere with insulin's action. Insulin is often injected using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin pen \u2014 a device that looks like a large ink pen.\nAn insulin pump also may be an option. The pump is a device about the size of a small cellphone worn on the outside of your body. A tube connects the reservoir of insulin to a tube (catheter) that's inserted under the skin of your abdomen.\nContinuous glucose monitor and insulin pump\nContinuous glucose monitor and insulin pump\nA continuous glucose monitor, on the left, is a device that measures your blood sugar every few minutes using a sensor inserted under the skin. An insulin pump, attached to the pocket, is a device that's worn outside of the body with a tube that connects the reservoir of insulin to a catheter inserted under the skin of the abdomen. Insulin pumps are programmed to deliver specific amounts of insulin automatically and when you eat.\nA continuous glucose monitor, on the left, is a device that measures blood sugar every few minutes using a sensor inserted under the skin. An insulin pump, attached to the pocket, is a device that's worn outside of the body with a tube that connects the reservoir of insulin to a catheter inserted under the skin of the abdomen. Insulin pumps are programmed to deliver specific amounts of insulin continuously and with food.\nA tubeless pump that works wirelessly is also now available. You program an insulin pump to dispense specific amounts of insulin. It can be adjusted to give out more or less insulin depending on meals, activity level and blood sugar level.\nA closed loop system is a device implanted in the body that links a continuous glucose monitor to an insulin pump. The monitor checks blood sugar levels regularly. The device automatically delivers the right amount of insulin when the monitor shows that it's needed.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved several hybrid closed loop systems for type 1 diabetes. They are called \"hybrid\" because these systems require some input from the user. For example, you may have to tell the device how many carbohydrates are eaten, or confirm blood sugar levels from time to time.\nA closed loop system that doesn't need any user input isn't available yet. But more of these systems currently are in clinical trials.\nOral or other drugs\nSometimes your provider may prescribe other oral or injected drugs as well. Some diabetes drugs help your pancreas to release more insulin. Others prevent the production and release of glucose from your liver, which means you need less insulin to move sugar into your cells.\nStill others block the action of stomach or intestinal enzymes that break down carbohydrates, slowing their absorption, or make your tissues more sensitive to insulin. Metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) is generally the first drug prescribed for type 2 diabetes.\nAnother class of medication called SGLT2 inhibitors may be used. They work by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing filtered sugar into the blood. Instead, the sugar is eliminated in the urine.\nTransplantation\nIn some people who have type 1 diabetes, a pancreas transplant may be an option. Islet transplants are being studied as well. With a successful pancreas transplant, you would no longer need insulin therapy.\nBut transplants aren't always successful. And these procedures pose serious risks. You need a lifetime of immune-suppressing drugs to prevent organ rejection. These drugs can have serious side effects. Because of this, transplants are usually reserved for people whose diabetes can't be controlled or those who also need a kidney transplant.\nBariatric surgery\nSome people with type 2 diabetes who are obese and have a body mass index higher than 35 may be helped by some types of bariatric surgery. People who've had gastric bypass have seen major improvements in their blood sugar levels. But this procedure's long-term risks and benefits for type 2 diabetes aren't yet known.\nTreatment for gestational diabetes\nControlling your blood sugar level is essential to keeping your baby healthy. It can also keep you from having complications during delivery. In addition to having a healthy diet and exercising regularly, your treatment plan for gestational diabetes may include monitoring your blood sugar. In some cases, you may also use insulin or oral drugs.\nYour provider will monitor your blood sugar level during labor. If your blood sugar rises, your baby may release high levels of insulin. This can lead to low blood sugar right after birth.\nTreatment for prediabetes\nTreatment for prediabetes usually involves healthy lifestyle choices. These habits can help bring your blood sugar level back to normal. Or it could keep it from rising toward the levels seen in type 2 diabetes. Keeping a healthy weight through exercise and healthy eating can help. Exercising at least 150 minutes a week and losing about 7% of your body weight may prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.\nDrugs \u2014 such as metformin, statins and high blood pressure medications \u2014 may be an option for some people with prediabetes and other conditions such as heart disease.\nSigns of trouble in any type of diabetes\nMany factors can affect your blood sugar. Problems may sometimes come up that need care right away.\nHigh blood sugar\nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycemia in diabetes) can occur for many reasons, including eating too much, being sick or not taking enough glucose-lowering medication. Check your blood sugar level as directed by your provider. And watch for symptoms of high blood sugar, including:\n- Urinating often\n- Feeling thirstier than usual\n- Blurred vision\n- Tiredness (fatigue)\n- Headache\n- Irritability\nIf you have hyperglycemia, you'll need to adjust your meal plan, drugs or both.\nIncreased ketones in your urine\nDiabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes. If your cells are starved for energy, your body may begin to break down fat. This makes toxic acids known as ketones, which can build up in the blood. Watch for the following symptoms:\n- Nausea\n- Vomiting\n- Stomach (abdominal) pain\n- A sweet, fruity smell on your breath\n- Shortness of breath\n- Dry mouth\n- Weakness\n- Confusion\n- Coma\nYou can check your urine for excess ketones with a ketones test kit that you can get without a prescription. If you have excess ketones in your urine, talk with your provider right away or seek emergency care. This condition is more common in people with type 1 diabetes.\nHyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome\nHyperosmolar syndrome is caused by very high blood sugar that turns blood thick and syrupy.\nSymptoms of this life-threatening condition include:\n- A blood sugar reading over 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L)\n- Dry mouth\n- Extreme thirst\n- Fever\n- Drowsiness\n- Confusion\n- Vision loss\n- Hallucinations\nThis condition is seen in people with type 2 diabetes. It often happens after an illness. Call your provider or seek medical care right away if you have symptoms of this condition.\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\nIf your blood sugar level drops below your target range, it's known as low blood sugar (diabetic hypoglycemia). If you're taking drugs that lower your blood sugar, including insulin, your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons. These include skipping a meal and getting more physical activity than normal. Low blood sugar also occurs if you take too much insulin or too much of a glucose-lowering medication that causes the pancreas to hold insulin.\nCheck your blood sugar level regularly and watch for symptoms of low blood sugar, including:\n- Sweating\n- Shakiness\n- Weakness\n- Hunger\n- Dizziness\n- Headache\n- Blurred vision\n- Heart palpitations\n- Irritability\n- Slurred speech\n- Drowsiness\n- Confusion\n- Fainting\n- Seizures\nLow blood sugar is best treated with carbohydrates that your body can absorb quickly, such as fruit juice or glucose tablets.\nClinical trials\nExplore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.\nLifestyle and home remedies\nDiabetes is a serious disease. Following your diabetes treatment plan takes total commitment. Careful management of diabetes can lower your risk of serious or life-threatening complications.\n- Commit to managing your diabetes. Learn all you can about diabetes. Build a relationship with a diabetes educator. Ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.\n- Choose healthy foods and stay at a healthy weight. If you're overweight, losing just 7% of your body weight can make a difference in your blood sugar control if you have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. A healthy diet is one with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains and legumes. And limit how much food with saturated fat you eat.\n-\nMake physical activity part of your daily routine. Regular physical activity can help prevent prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. It can also help those who already have diabetes to maintain better blood sugar control. A minimum of 30 minutes of moderate physical activity \u2014 such as brisk walking \u2014 most days of the week is recommended. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity a week.\nGetting regular aerobic exercise along with getting at least two days a week of strength training exercises can help control blood sugar more effectively than does either type of exercise alone. Aerobic exercises can include walking, biking or dancing. Resistance training can include weight training and body weight exercises.\nAlso try to spend less time sitting still. Try to get up and move around for a few minutes at least every 30 minutes or so when you're awake.\nLifestyle recommendations for type 1 and type 2 diabetes\nAlso, if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes:\n- Identify yourself. Wear a tag or bracelet that says you have diabetes. Keep a glucagon kit nearby in case of a low blood sugar emergency. Make sure your friends and loved ones know how to use it.\n- Schedule a yearly physical and regular eye exams. Your regular diabetes checkups aren't meant to replace yearly physicals or routine eye exams. During the physical, your provider will look for any diabetes-related complications and screen for other medical problems. Your eye care specialist will check for signs of eye damage, including retinal damage (retinopathy), cataracts and glaucoma.\n-\nKeep your vaccinations up to date. High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. Get a flu shot every year. Your provider may recommend the pneumonia and COVID-19 vaccines, as well.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also currently recommends hepatitis B vaccination if you haven't previously had it and you're an adult ages 19 to 59 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\nThe most recent CDC guidelines suggest vaccination as soon as possible after diagnosis with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. If you are age 60 or older, have been diagnosed with diabetes, and haven't previously received the vaccine, talk to your provider about whether it's right for you.\n- Pay attention to your feet. Wash your feet daily in lukewarm water. Dry them gently, especially between the toes. Moisturize with lotion, but not between the toes. Check your feet every day for blisters, cuts, sores, redness or swelling. Talk to your provider if you have a sore or other foot problem that doesn't heal quickly on its own.\n- Control your blood pressure and cholesterol. Eating healthy foods and exercising regularly can help control high blood pressure and cholesterol. Drugs may be needed, too.\n- Take care of your teeth. Diabetes may leave you prone to more-serious gum infections. Brush and floss your teeth at least twice a day. And if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, schedule regular dental exams. Talk to your dentist right away if your gums bleed or look red or swollen.\n- If you smoke or use other types of tobacco, ask your provider to help you quit. Smoking increases your risk of many diabetes complications. Smokers who have diabetes are more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than are nonsmokers who have diabetes. Talk to your provider about ways to stop smoking or to stop using other types of tobacco.\n-\nIf you drink alcohol, do so responsibly. Alcohol can cause either high or low blood sugar. This depends on how much you drink and if you eat at the same time. If you choose to drink, do so only in moderation \u2014 one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men \u2014 and always with food.\nRemember to include the carbohydrates from any alcohol you drink in your daily carbohydrate count. And check your blood sugar levels before going to bed.\n- Take stress seriously. The hormones your body may make in response to long-term stress may prevent insulin from working properly. This will raise your blood sugar and stress you even more. Set limits for yourself and prioritize your tasks. Learn relaxation techniques. And get plenty of sleep.\nAlternative medicine\nMany substances have been shown to improve the body's ability to process insulin in some studies. Other studies fail to find any benefit for blood sugar control or in lowering A1C levels. Because of the conflicting findings, there aren't any alternative therapies that are currently recommended to help everyone to manage blood sugar.\nIf you decide to try any type of alternative therapy, don't stop taking the drugs that your provider has prescribed. Be sure to discuss the use of any of these therapies with your provider. Make sure that they won't cause bad reactions or interact with your current therapy.\nAlso, no treatments \u2014 alternative or conventional \u2014 can cure diabetes. If you're using insulin therapy for diabetes, never stop using insulin unless directed to do so by your provider.\nCoping and support\nLiving with diabetes can be difficult and frustrating. Sometimes, even when you've done everything right, your blood sugar levels may rise. But stick with your diabetes management plan and you'll likely see a positive difference in your A1C when you visit your provider.\nGood diabetes management can take a great deal of time and feel overwhelming. Some people find that it helps to talk to someone. Your provider can probably recommend a mental health professional for you to speak with. Or you may want to try a support group.\nSharing your frustrations and triumphs with people who understand what you're going through can be very helpful. And you may find that others have great tips to share about diabetes management.\nYour provider may know of a local support group. You can also call the American Diabetes Association at 800-DIABETES (800-342-2383) or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation at 800-533-CURE (800-533-2873).\nPreparing for your appointment\nYou're likely to start by seeing your health care provider if you're having diabetes symptoms. If your child is having diabetes symptoms, you might see your child's health care provider. If blood sugar levels are very high, you'll likely be sent to the emergency room.\nIf blood sugar levels aren't high enough to put you or your child immediately at risk, you may be referred to a provider trained in diagnosing and treating diabetes (endocrinologist). Soon after diagnosis, you'll also likely meet with a diabetes educator and a registered dietitian to get more information on managing your diabetes.\nHere's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and to know what to expect.\nWhat you can do\n- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. When you make the appointment, ask if you need to do anything in advance. This will likely include restricting your diet, such as for a fasting blood sugar test.\n- Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated.\n- Write down key personal information, including major stresses or recent life changes. If you're monitoring your glucose values at home, bring a record of the glucose results, detailing the dates and times of testing.\n- Make a list of any allergies you have and all medications, vitamins and supplements you're taking.\n- Record your family medical history. Be sure to note any relatives who have had diabetes, heart attacks or strokes.\n- Bring a family member or friend, if possible. Someone who accompanies you can help you remember information you need.\n- Write down questions to ask your provider. Ask about aspects of your diabetes management you're unclear about.\n- Be aware if you need any prescription refills. Your provider can renew your prescriptions while you're there.\nPreparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time with your provider. For diabetes, some questions to ask include:\n- Are the symptoms I'm having related to diabetes or something else?\n- Do I need any tests?\n- What else can I do to protect my health?\n- What are other options to manage my diabetes?\n- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?\n- Are there restrictions I need to follow?\n- Should I see another specialist, such as a dietitian or diabetes educator?\n- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?\n- Are there brochures or other printed material I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?\nWhat to expect from your doctor\nYour provider is likely to ask you many questions, such as:\n- Can you describe your symptoms?\n- Do you have symptoms all the time, or do they come and go?\n- How severe are your symptoms?\n- Do you have a family history of preeclampsia or diabetes?\n- Tell me about your diet.\n- Do you exercise? What type and how much?",

            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444?p=1": "Overview\nDiabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.\nThe main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.\nChronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.\nSymptoms\nDiabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. Some people, especially if they have prediabetes, gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.\nSome of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are:\n- Feeling more thirsty than usual.\n- Urinating often.\n- Losing weight without trying.\n- Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin.\n- Feeling tired and weak.\n- Feeling irritable or having other mood changes.\n- Having blurry vision.\n- Having slow-healing sores.\n- Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.\nType 1 diabetes can start at any age. But it often starts during childhood or teen years. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40. But type 2 diabetes in children is increasing.\nWhen to see a doctor\n- If you think you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your health care provider. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.\n- If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize.\nCauses\nTo understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose.\nHow insulin works\nInsulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas).\n- The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream.\n- The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells.\n- Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.\n- As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.\nThe role of glucose\nGlucose \u2014 a sugar \u2014 is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.\n- Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.\n- Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\n- The liver stores and makes glucose.\n- When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps your glucose level within a typical range.\nThe exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. It is unclear what those factors may be.\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Family history may play a part in all types. Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes.\nSometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.\nRace or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, certain people \u2014 including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people \u2014 are at higher risk.\nPrediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are more common in people who are overweight or obese.\nComplications\nLong-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes \u2014 and the less controlled your blood sugar \u2014 the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. In fact, prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes. Possible complications include:\n- Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems. These can include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke.\n-\nNerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.\nDamage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction.\n- Kidney damage from diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). The kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system.\n- Eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye. This could lead to blindness.\n- Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications.\n- Skin and mouth conditions. Diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.\n- Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.\n- Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease.\n- Depression related to diabetes. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nComplications of gestational diabetes\nMost women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby.\nComplications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes, including:\n- Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta. Extra glucose triggers the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large. It can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a C-section.\n- Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. This is because their own insulin production is high.\n- Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\n- Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.\nComplications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes, including:\n- Preeclampsia. Symptoms of this condition include high blood pressure, too much protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet.\n- Gestational diabetes. If you had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy.\nPrevention\nType 1 diabetes can't be prevented. But the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them:\n- Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Eat a variety to keep from feeling bored.\n- Get more physical activity. Try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week. Or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. For example, take a brisk daily walk. If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day.\n-\nLose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms), losing 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) can lower the risk of diabetes.\nBut don't try to lose weight during pregnancy. Talk to your provider about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy.\nTo keep your weight in a healthy range, work on long-term changes to your eating and exercise habits. Remember the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and higher self-esteem.\nSometimes drugs are an option. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. But healthy lifestyle choices are important. If you have prediabetes, have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to make sure you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.",

            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355278": "Hello. I'm Dr. Eleanna De Filippis, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of insulin resistance. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. To understand insulin resistance, often referred to as prediabetes, let's first talk about what insulin does. When you eat food, your body converts that food into dietary sugars. Insulin is a hormone released by the pancreas that tells your cells to open up to that sugar and convert it into energy. With insulin resistance, the cells don't react, and don't open up, resulting in excessive sugar in the blood. Over time, the pancreas keeps trying to regulate the blood sugar, producing more and more insulin until it wears out and can't produce large amounts of insulin anymore. As a result, blood sugar levels increase to the point of being in the diabetic range.\nWho gets it?\nAnyone can become insulin-resistant. In particular, people with excess weight are at a higher risk, compared to the general population. Risk is further increased with a family history of type two diabetes, age over 45, African, Latino or Native American ancestry, smoking, and certain medications, including steroids, anti-psychotics, and HIV medication. There are other medical conditions associated with insulin resistance, like obstructive sleep apnea, fatty liver disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, also known as PCOS, Cushing's syndrome, and lipodystrophy syndromes. Lipodystrophy syndromes are conditions that cause abnormal fat loss. So carrying either too much or not enough fat tissue in your body can be associated with insulin resistance.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nVery often people with insulin resistance don't have any symptoms at all. It is usually picked up by their doctor during an annual health exam or routine blood work. There are some signs of insulin resistance that your doctor may look for. These includes a waistline over 40 inches in men, and a waistline over 35 inches in women. Skin tags or patches of dark velvety skin called acanthosis nigricans. A blood pressure reading of 130 over 80 or higher. A fasting glucose level equal or above 100 milligrams per deciliter. Or a blood sugar level equal or above 140 milligrams per deciliter two hours after a glucose load test. An A1C between 5.7% and 6.3%. A fasting triglycerides level over 150 milligram per deciliter. And an HDL cholesterol level under 40 milligrams per deciliter in men, and an HDL cholesterol level under 50 milligrams per deciliter in women.\nHow is it diagnosed?\nIf your doctor spots these symptoms, they may follow up with a physical exam and a variety of blood tests that measure the levels of glucose, or sugar, in your blood and/or your tolerance to that glucose. Or more recently, a blood test called hemoglobin glycosylated A1C, often simply referred to as A1C.\nHow is it treated?\nReversing insulin resistance and preventing type two diabetes is possible through lifestyle changes, medication, or sometimes both. Healthy bodies come in different shapes and sizes. Losing weight through drastic means can be dangerous and counterproductive. Instead, get ideas from a doctor or a nutritionist about ways to incorporate healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and lean proteins into your meals. Also, consider incorporating exercise and movement into your day-to-day life in ways that make you feel good.\nWhat now?\nEven though permanently defeating insulin resistance isn't always possible, you can help your body to be more receptive to insulin. Listen to your body, reduce stress, give it the nutrition and activity it desires. If you'd like to learn even more about insulin resistance, watch our other related videos or visit mayoclinic.org. We wish you well.",
            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gestational-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355339": "Overview\nGestational diabetes is diabetes diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy (gestation). Like other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes affects how your cells use sugar (glucose). Gestational diabetes causes high blood sugar that can affect your pregnancy and your baby's health.\nWhile any pregnancy complication is concerning, there's good news. During pregnancy you can help control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising and, if necessary, taking medication. Controlling blood sugar can keep you and your baby healthy and prevent a difficult delivery.\nIf you have gestational diabetes during pregnancy, generally your blood sugar returns to its usual level soon after delivery. But if you've had gestational diabetes, you have a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes. You'll need to be tested for changes in blood sugar more often.\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, gestational diabetes doesn't cause noticeable signs or symptoms. Increased thirst and more-frequent urination are possible symptoms.\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf possible, seek health care early \u2014 when you first think about trying to get pregnant \u2014 so your health care provider can check your risk of gestational diabetes along with your overall wellness. Once you're pregnant, your health care provider will check you for gestational diabetes as part of your prenatal care.\nIf you develop gestational diabetes, you may need checkups more often. These are most likely to occur during the last three months of pregnancy, when your health care provider will monitor your blood sugar level and your baby's health.\nFrom Mayo Clinic to your inbox\nCauses\nResearchers don't yet know why some women get gestational diabetes and others don't. Excess weight before pregnancy often plays a role.\nUsually, various hormones work to keep blood sugar levels in check. But during pregnancy, hormone levels change, making it harder for the body to process blood sugar efficiently. This makes blood sugar rise.\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for gestational diabetes include:\n- Being overweight or obese\n- Not being physically active\n- Having prediabetes\n- Having had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy\n- Having polycystic ovary syndrome\n- Having an immediate family member with diabetes\n- Having previously delivered a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms)\n- Being of a certain race or ethnicity, such as Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American\nComplications\nGestational diabetes that's not carefully managed can lead to high blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can cause problems for you and your baby, including an increased likelihood of needing a surgery to deliver (C-section).\nComplications that may affect your baby\nIf you have gestational diabetes, your baby may be at increased risk of:\n- Excessive birth weight. If your blood sugar level is higher than the standard range, it can cause your baby to grow too large. Very large babies \u2014 those who weigh 9 pounds or more \u2014 are more likely to become wedged in the birth canal, have birth injuries or need a C-section birth.\n- Early (preterm) birth. High blood sugar may increase the risk of early labor and delivery before the due date. Or early delivery may be recommended because the baby is large.\n- Serious breathing difficulties. Babies born early may experience respiratory distress syndrome \u2014 a condition that makes breathing difficult.\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Sometimes babies have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. Severe episodes of hypoglycemia may cause seizures in the baby. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal.\n- Obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\n- Stillbirth. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth.\nComplications that may affect you\nGestational diabetes may also increase your risk of:\n- High blood pressure and preeclampsia. Gestational diabetes raises your risk of high blood pressure, as well as preeclampsia \u2014 a serious complication of pregnancy that causes high blood pressure and other symptoms that can threaten both your life and your baby's life.\n- Having a surgical delivery (C-section). You're more likely to have a C-section if you have gestational diabetes.\n- Future diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, you're more likely to get it again during a future pregnancy. You also have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes as you get older.\nPrevention\nThere are no guarantees when it comes to preventing gestational diabetes \u2014 but the more healthy habits you can adopt before pregnancy, the better. If you've had gestational diabetes, these healthy choices may also reduce your risk of having it again in future pregnancies or developing type 2 diabetes in the future.\n- Eat healthy foods. Choose foods high in fiber and low in fat and calories. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to help you achieve your goals without compromising taste or nutrition. Watch portion sizes.\n- Keep active. Exercising before and during pregnancy can help protect you from developing gestational diabetes. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days of the week. Take a brisk daily walk. Ride your bike. Swim laps. Short bursts of activity \u2014 such as parking further away from the store when you run errands or taking a short walk break \u2014 all add up.\n- Start pregnancy at a healthy weight. If you're planning to get pregnant, losing extra weight beforehand may help you have a healthier pregnancy. Focus on making lasting changes to your eating habits that can help you through pregnancy, such as eating more vegetables and fruits.\n- Don't gain more weight than recommended. Gaining some weight during pregnancy is typical and healthy. But gaining too much weight too quickly can increase your risk of gestational diabetes. Ask your health care provider what a reasonable amount of weight gain is for you.",
            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193": "Overview\nType 2 diabetes happens when the body cannot use insulin correctly and sugar builds up in the blood. It was once called adult-onset diabetes.\nOver time, high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. This can happen because the pancreas doesn't make enough of a hormone called insulin that helps sugar enter the cells. It happens also because the cells respond poorly to insulin by taking in less sugar.\nBoth type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more young people with type 2 diabetes.\nThere's no cure for type 2 diabetes. Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the condition. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage blood sugar, diabetes medicines or insulin therapy may help.\nProducts & Services\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of type 2 diabetes often come on slowly. In fact, people can live with type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. When there are symptoms, they may include:\n- More thirst.\n- More urination.\n- More hunger.\n- Weight loss.\n- Tiredness.\n- Blurred vision.\n- Slow-healing sores.\n- Frequent infections.\n- Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet.\n- Areas of darkened skin, most often in the armpits and neck.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of type 2 diabetes.\nCauses\nType 2 diabetes is mainly the result of two issues:\n- Cells in muscle, fat and the liver don't respond to insulin as they should. As a result, the cells don't take in enough sugar.\n- The gland that makes insulin, called the pancreas, can't make enough to keep blood sugar levels within a healthy range.\nBeing overweight and not moving enough are key factors.\nHow insulin works\nInsulin is a hormone that comes from a gland that sits behind and below the stomach. The gland is called the pancreas. Insulin manages how the body uses sugar in the following ways:\n- Sugar in the bloodstream causes the pancreas to release insulin.\n- Insulin in the bloodstream gets sugar into the cells.\n- The amount of sugar in the bloodstream drops.\n- Then the pancreas releases less insulin.\nThe role of glucose\nA sugar called glucose is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.\n- Glucose comes from two major sources. They are food and the liver.\n- Glucose goes into the bloodstream. There it enters cells with the help of insulin.\n- The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen and also makes glucose.\n- When glucose levels are low, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps the body's glucose level within a healthy range.\nIn type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into the cells, sugar builds up in the blood. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas releases more insulin. Over time, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin are damaged. Then the cells can't make enough insulin to meet the body's needs.\nRisk factors\nFactors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include:\n- Excess weight. Being overweight or obese is a main risk.\n- Waist size. Storing fat mainly in the belly rather than in the hips and thighs raises the risk. The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher in people assigned male at birth whose waists measure more than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters). For people assigned female at birth, a waist measure of more than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) raises the risk.\n- Sitting. The less active a person is, the higher the risk. Physical activity helps manage weight, uses up glucose as energy and helps cells take in insulin.\n- Family history. Having a parent or sibling who has type 2 diabetes raises the risk.\n- Race and ethnicity. It's not clear why, but people of certain races and ethnicities are more likely to get type 2 diabetes than white people are. Races and ethnicities include Black people, Hispanic people, Native American and Asian people, and Pacific Island people.\n- Blood lipid levels. A higher risk is linked with low levels of high-density lipoprotein. Also called HDL cholesterol, this is the \"good\" cholesterol. Higher risk also is linked with high levels of a certain type of fat in the blood, called triglycerides.\n- Age. The risk of type 2 diabetes goes up with age, mainly after age 35.\n- Prediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is higher than the standard range, but not high enough to be called type 2 diabetes. If not treated, prediabetes often moves on to become type 2 diabetes.\n- Pregnancy-related risks. The risk of getting type 2 diabetes is higher in people who had gestational diabetes when they were pregnant. And it's higher in those who gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms).\n- Polycystic ovary syndrome. This condition results in irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity. It raises the risk of diabetes.\nComplications\nType 2 diabetes affects many major organs. These include the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Also, factors that raise the risk of diabetes are risk factors for other serious diseases. Managing diabetes and blood sugar can lower the risk for these complications and other medical conditions, including:\n- Heart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes is linked with a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and narrowed blood vessels, called atherosclerosis.\n- Nerve damage in arms and legs. This condition is called neuropathy. High blood sugar over time can damage or destroy nerves. Neuropathy may cause tingling, numbness, burning, pain or loss of feeling. It most often begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and slowly spreads upward.\n- Other nerve damage. Damage to nerves of the heart can cause irregular heart rhythms. Nerve damage in the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. Nerve damage also may cause erectile dysfunction.\n- Kidney disease. Diabetes may lead to long-term kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease that can't be reversed. End-stage kidney disease may need to be treated with mechanical filtering of the kidneys, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant.\n- Eye damage. Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye conditions. Conditions include cataracts and glaucoma. Diabetes also may damage the blood vessels of the retina, which is the part of the eye that senses light. This is called diabetic retinopathy. This damage can lead to blindness.\n- Skin conditions. Diabetes may raise the risk of some skin problems. Skin problems may include bacterial and fungal infections.\n- Slow healing. Cuts and blisters that aren't treated can become serious infections. The infections may heal poorly. Bad damage can result in the need to use surgery to remove a toe, foot or leg. This surgery is called amputation.\n- Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.\n- Sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people who have type 2 diabetes. Obesity may be the main cause of both conditions.\n- Dementia. Type 2 diabetes seems to raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other conditions that cause dementia. Poorly managed blood sugar is linked to a faster loss of memory and other thinking skills.\nPrevention\nHealthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, lifestyle changes may slow the condition or keep it from becoming diabetes.\nA healthy lifestyle includes the following:\n- Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n- Be active. Aim for 150 or more minutes a week of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, bicycling, running or swimming.\n- Lose weight. If you are overweight, losing some weight and keeping it off may slow prediabetes from becoming type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, losing 7% to 10% of your body weight may lower the risk of diabetes.\n- Don't sit for long. Sitting for long periods can raise the risk of type 2 diabetes. Get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes.\nPeople with prediabetes may take metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others), a diabetes medicine, to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is most often prescribed for older adults who are obese and who can't lower blood sugar levels with lifestyle changes.\nFeb. 27, 2025",
            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011": "I'm Dr. Yogish C. Kudva an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of type 1 diabetes. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love. We are here to give you the best information available. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the insulin making cells of the pancreas. It's estimated that about 1.25 million Americans live with it. People with type 1 diabetes don't make enough insulin. An important hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin allows your cells to store sugar or glucose and fat and produce energy. Unfortunately, there is no known cure. But treatment can prevent complications and also improve everyday life for patients with type 1 diabetes. Lots of people with type 1 diabetes live a full life. And the more we learn and develop treatment for the disorder, the better the outcome.\nWe don't know what exactly causes type 1 diabetes. We believe that it is an auto-immune disorder where the body mistakenly destroys insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Typically, the pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter your cells. This sugar or glucose, is the main source of energy for cells in the brain, muscle cells, and other tissues. However, once most insulin producing cells are destroyed, the pancreas can't produce enough insulin, meaning the glucose can't enter the cells, resulting in an excess of blood sugar floating in the bloodstream. This can cause life-threatening complications. And this condition is called diabetic ketoacidosis. Although we don't know what causes it, we do know certain factors can contribute to the onset of type 1 diabetes. Family history. Anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing it. Genetics. The presence of certain genes can also indicate an increased risk. Geography. Type 1 diabetes becomes more common as you travel away from the equator. Age, although it can occur at any age there are two noticeable peaks. The first occurs in children between four and seven years of age and the second is between 10 and 14 years old.\nSigns and symptoms of type 1 diabetes can appear rather suddenly, especially in children. They may include increased thirst, frequent urination, bed wetting in children who previously didn't wet the bed. Extreme hunger, unintended weight loss, fatigue and weakness, blurred vision, irritability, and other mood changes. If you or your child are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should talk to your doctor.\nThe best way to determine if you have type 1 diabetes is a blood test. There are different methods such as an A1C test, a random blood sugar test, or a fasting blood sugar test. They are all effective and your doctor can help determine what's appropriate for you. If you are diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor may order additional tests to check for antibodies that are common in type 1 diabetes in the test called C-peptide, which measures the amount of insulin produced when checked simultaneously with a fasting glucose. These tests can help distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes when a diagnosis is uncertain.\nIf you have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you may be wondering what treatment looks like. It could mean taking insulin, counting carbohydrates, fat protein, and monitoring your glucose frequently, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly to maintain a healthy weight. Generally, those with type 1 diabetes will need lifelong insulin therapy. There are many different types of insulin and more are being developed that are more efficient. And what you may take may change. Again, your doctor will help you navigate what's right for you. A significant advance in treatment from the last several years has been the development and availability of continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps that automatically adjust insulin working with the continuous glucose monitor. This type of treatment is the best treatment at this time for type 1 diabetes. This is an exciting time for patients and for physicians that are keen to develop, prescribe such therapies. Surgery is another option. A successful pancreas transplant can erase the need for additional insulin. However, transplants aren't always available, not successful and the procedure can pose serious risks. Sometimes it may outweigh the dangers of diabetes itself. So transplants are often reserved for those with very difficult to manage conditions. A successful transplant can bring life transforming results. However, surgery is always a serious endeavor and requires ample research and concentration from you, your family, and your medical team.\nThe fact that we don't know what causes type 1 diabetes can be alarming. The fact that we don't have a cure for it even more so. But with the right doctor, medical team and treatment, type 1 diabetes can be managed. So those who live with it can get on living.

            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes-in-children/symptoms-causes/syc-20355306": "Overview\nType 1 diabetes in children is a condition in which your child's body no longer produces an important hormone (insulin). Your child needs insulin to survive, so the missing insulin needs to be replaced with injections or with an insulin pump. Type 1 diabetes in children used to be known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes.\nThe diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children can be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. Suddenly you and your child \u2014 depending on your child's age \u2014 must learn how to give injections, count carbohydrates and monitor blood sugar.\nThere's no cure for type 1 diabetes in children, but it can be managed. Advances in blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery have improved blood sugar management and quality of life for children with type 1 diabetes.\nSymptoms\nThe signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children usually develop quickly, and may include:\n- Increased thirst\n- Frequent urination, possibly bed-wetting in a toilet-trained child\n- Extreme hunger\n- Unintentional weight loss\n- Fatigue\n- Irritability or behavior changes\n- Fruity-smelling breath\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your child's health care provider if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of type 1 diabetes.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. But in most people with type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system \u2014 which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses \u2014 mistakenly destroys insulin-producing (islet) cells in the pancreas. Genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role in this process.\nOnce the islet cells of the pancreas are destroyed, your child produces little or no insulin. Insulin performs the critical job of moving sugar (glucose) from the bloodstream to the body's cells for energy.\nSugar enters the bloodstream when food is digested. Without enough insulin, sugar builds up in your child's bloodstream. This can cause life-threatening complications if left untreated.\nRisk factors\nType 1 diabetes most often occurs in children but can occur at any age. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes in children include:\n- Family history. Anyone with a parent or siblings with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition.\n- Genetics. Certain genes indicate an increased risk of type 1 diabetes.\n- Race. In the United States, type 1 diabetes is more common among white children of non-Hispanic descent than among children of other races.\n- Certain viruses. Exposure to various viruses may trigger the autoimmune destruction of the islet cells.\nComplications\nType 1 diabetes can affect the major organs in your body. Keeping your blood sugar level close to normal most of the time can dramatically reduce the risk of many complications.\nComplications can include:\n- Heart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes increases your child's risk of developing conditions such as narrowed blood vessels, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke later in life.\n- Nerve damage. Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your child's nerves. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain. Nerve damage usually happens gradually over a long period of time.\n- Kidney damage. Diabetes can damage the numerous tiny blood vessel clusters in the kidneys that filter waste from your child's blood.\n- Eye damage. Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye's retina, which may lead to vision problems.\n- Osteoporosis. Diabetes may decrease bone mineral density, increasing your child's risk of osteoporosis as an adult.\nYou can help your child prevent diabetes complications by:\n- Working with your child to maintain good blood sugar control as much as possible\n- Teaching your child the importance of eating a healthy diet and participating in regular physical activity\n- Scheduling regular visits with your child's diabetes health care professional\nChildren with type 1 diabetes are at risk of other autoimmune disorders, such as thyroid disease and celiac disease. Your child's health care provider may recommend tests for these conditions.\nPrevention\nThere's currently no sure way to prevent type 1 diabetes, but this is a very active area of research.\nThe antibodies associated with type 1 diabetes in children who have a high risk of the disorder can be detected months or even years before the first symptoms of type 1 diabetes appear. Researchers are working on:\n- Preventing or delaying the start of type 1 diabetes in people who have a high risk of the disease.\n- Preventing further destruction of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed.\nSept. 02, 2023",
            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes-in-children/symptoms-causes/syc-20355318": "Overview\nType 2 diabetes in children is a chronic disease that affects the way your child's body processes sugar (glucose) for fuel. Without treatment, the disorder causes sugar to build up in the bloodstream, which can lead to serious long-term consequences.\nType 2 diabetes occurs more commonly in adults. In fact, it used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But the increasing number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people.\nThere's plenty you can do to help manage or prevent type 2 diabetes in your child. Encourage your child to eat healthy foods, get plenty of physical activity and maintain a healthy weight. If healthy eating and exercise aren't enough to control type 2 diabetes, oral medication or insulin treatment may be needed.\nSymptoms\nType 2 diabetes in children may develop so gradually that there are no noticeable symptoms. Sometimes, the disorder is diagnosed during a routine check-up.\nSome children might experience these signs and symptoms as a result of too much sugar in their bloodstreams:\n- Increased thirst\n- Frequent urination\n- Increased hunger\n- Fatigue\n- Blurry vision\n- Darkened areas of skin, most often around the neck or in the armpits and groin\n- Unintended weight loss, although this is less common in children with type 2 diabetes than in children with type 1 diabetes\n- Frequent infections\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your child's health care provider if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Undiagnosed, the disease can cause serious damage.\nDiabetes screening is recommended for children who have started puberty or are at least 10 years old, who are overweight or obese, and who have at least one other risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of type 2 diabetes is unknown. But family history and genetics appear to play an important role. What is clear is that children with type 2 diabetes can't process sugar (glucose) properly.\nMost of the sugar in the body comes from food. When food is digested, sugar enters the bloodstream. Insulin allows sugar to enter the cells \u2014 and lowers the amount of sugar in the blood.\nInsulin is produced by a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas. The pancreas sends insulin to the blood when food is eaten. When the blood sugar level starts to drop, the pancreas slows down the secretion of insulin into the blood.\nWhen your child has type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work as well. As a result, instead of fueling cells, sugar builds up in your child's bloodstream. This can happen because:\n- The pancreas may not make enough insulin\n- The cells become resistant to insulin and don't allow as much sugar in\nRisk factors\nResearchers don't fully understand why some children develop type 2 diabetes and others don't, even if they have similar risk factors. However, it's clear that certain factors increase the risk, including:\n- Weight. Being overweight is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes in children. The more fatty tissue children have \u2014 especially inside and between the muscle and skin around the abdomen \u2014 the more resistant their bodies' cells become to insulin.\n- Inactivity. The less active children are, the greater their risk of type 2 diabetes.\n- Diet. Eating red meat and processed meat and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.\n- Family history. Children's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if they have a parent or sibling with the disease.\n- Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people \u2014 including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people \u2014 are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\n- Age and sex. Many children develop type 2 diabetes in their early teens, but it may occur at any age. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than are adolescent boys.\n- Maternal gestational diabetes. Children born to women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n- Low birth weight or preterm birth. Having a low birth weight is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Babies born prematurely \u2014 before 39 to 42 weeks' gestation \u2014have a greater risk of type 2 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes in children is often associated with metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovarian syndrome.\nMetabolic syndrome\nWhen certain conditions occur with obesity, they are associated with insulin resistance and can increase the risk of diabetes \u2014 and heart disease and stroke. A combination of the following conditions is often called metabolic syndrome:\n- High blood pressure\n- Low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), the \"good\" cholesterol\n- High triglycerides\n- High blood sugar levels\n- Large waist size\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects young females after puberty. PCOS is caused by an imbalance of hormones, resulting in signs such as weight gain, irregular menstrual periods, and excess face and body hair. People with PCOS often have problems with metabolism that can result in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.\nComplications\nType 2 diabetes can affect nearly every organ in your child's body, including the blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. The long-term complications of type 2 diabetes develop gradually over many years. Eventually, diabetes complications may be severe or even life-threatening.\nComplications of type 2 diabetes are related to high blood sugar and include:\n- High cholesterol\n- Heart and blood vessel disease\n- Stroke\n- Nerve damage\n- Kidney disease\n- Eye disease, including blindness\nKeeping your child's blood sugar level close to the standard range most of the time can dramatically reduce the risk of these complications. You can help your child prevent diabetes complications by:\n- Working with your child to maintain good blood sugar control as much as possible\n- Teaching your child the importance of healthy eating and participating in regular physical activity\n- Scheduling regular visits with your child's diabetes treatment team\nPrevention\nHealthy-lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children. Encourage your child to:\n- Eat healthy foods. Offer your child foods low in fat and calories. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom.\n- Get more physical activity. Encourage your child to become active. Sign up your child for a sports team or dance lessons.\nBetter yet, make it a family affair. The lifestyle choices that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children can do the same for adults.\nNov. 18, 2023",

            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-neuropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371580": "Overview\nDiabetic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that can occur if you have diabetes. High blood sugar (glucose) can injure nerves throughout the body. Diabetic neuropathy most often damages nerves in the legs and feet.\nDepending on the affected nerves, diabetic neuropathy symptoms include pain and numbness in the legs, feet and hands. It can also cause problems with the digestive system, urinary tract, blood vessels and heart. Some people have mild symptoms. But for others, diabetic neuropathy can be quite painful and disabling.\nDiabetic neuropathy is a serious diabetes complication that may affect as many as 50% of people with diabetes. But you can often prevent diabetic neuropathy or slow its progress with consistent blood sugar management and a healthy lifestyle.\nSymptoms\nThere are four main types of diabetic neuropathy. You can have one type or more than one type of neuropathy.\nYour symptoms depend on the type you have and which nerves are affected. Usually, symptoms develop gradually. You may not notice anything is wrong until considerable nerve damage has occurred.\nPeripheral neuropathy\nThis type of neuropathy may also be called distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy. It's the most common type of diabetic neuropathy. It affects the feet and legs first, followed by the hands and arms. Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are often worse at night, and may include:\n- Numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes\n- Tingling or burning feeling\n- Sharp pains or cramps\n- Muscle weakness\n- Extreme sensitivity to touch \u2014 for some people, even a bedsheet's weight can be painful\n- Serious foot problems, such as ulcers, infections, and bone and joint damage\nAutonomic neuropathy\nThe autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, eyes, bladder, digestive system and sex organs. Diabetes can affect nerves in any of these areas, possibly causing signs and symptoms including:\n- A lack of awareness that blood sugar levels are low (hypoglycemia unawareness)\n- Drops in blood pressure when rising from sitting or lying down that may cause dizziness or fainting (orthostatic hypotension)\n- Bladder or bowel problems\n- Slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis), causing nausea, vomiting, sensation of fullness and loss of appetite\n- Difficulty swallowing\n- Changes in the way the eyes adjust from light to dark or far to near\n- Increased or decreased sweating\n- Problems with sexual response, such as vaginal dryness in women and erectile dysfunction in men\nProximal neuropathy (diabetic polyradiculopathy)\nThis type of neuropathy often affects nerves in the thighs, hips, buttocks or legs. It can also affect the abdominal and chest area. Symptoms are usually on one side of the body, but may spread to the other side. Proximal neuropathy may include:\n- Severe pain in the buttock, hip or thigh\n- Weak and shrinking thigh muscles\n- Difficulty rising from a sitting position\n- Chest or abdominal wall pain\nMononeuropathy (focal neuropathy)\nMononeuropathy refers to damage to a single, specific nerve. The nerve may be in the face, torso, arm or leg. Mononeuropathy may lead to:\n- Difficulty focusing or double vision\n- Paralysis on one side of the face\n- Numbness or tingling in the hand or fingers\n- Weakness in the hand that may result in dropping things\n- Pain in the shin or foot\n- Weakness causing difficulty lifting the front part of the foot (foot drop)\n- Pain in the front of the thigh\nWhen to see a doctor\nCall your health care provider for an appointment if you have:\n- A cut or sore on your foot that is infected or won't heal\n- Burning, tingling, weakness or pain in your hands or feet that interferes with daily activities or sleep\n- Changes in digestion, urination or sexual function\n- Dizziness and fainting\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that screening for diabetic neuropathy begin immediately after someone is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or five years after diagnosis with type 1 diabetes. After that, screening is recommended once a year.\nFrom Mayo Clinic to your inbox\nCauses\nThe exact cause of each type of neuropathy is unknown. Researchers think that over time, uncontrolled high blood sugar damages nerves and interferes with their ability to send signals, leading to diabetic neuropathy. High blood sugar also weakens the walls of the small blood vessels (capillaries) that supply the nerves with oxygen and nutrients.\nRisk factors\nAnyone who has diabetes can develop neuropathy. But these risk factors make nerve damage more likely:\n- Poor blood sugar control. Uncontrolled blood sugar increases the risk of every diabetes complication, including nerve damage.\n- Diabetes history. The risk of diabetic neuropathy increases the longer a person has diabetes, especially if blood sugar isn't well controlled.\n- Kidney disease. Diabetes can damage the kidneys. Kidney damage sends toxins into the blood, which can lead to nerve damage.\n- Being overweight. Having a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or more may increase the risk of diabetic neuropathy.\n- Smoking. Smoking narrows and hardens the arteries, reducing blood flow to the legs and feet. This makes it more difficult for wounds to heal and damages the peripheral nerves.\nComplications\nDiabetic neuropathy can cause a number of serious complications, including:\n- Hypoglycemia unawareness. Blood sugar levels below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) \u2014 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) \u2014 usually cause shakiness, sweating and a fast heartbeat. But people who have autonomic neuropathy may not experience these warning signs.\n- Loss of a toe, foot or leg. Nerve damage can cause a loss of feeling in the feet, so even minor cuts can turn into sores or ulcers without being noticed. In severe cases, an infection can spread to the bone or lead to tissue death. Removal (amputation) of a toe, foot or even part of the leg may be necessary.\n- Urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence. If the nerves that control the bladder are damaged, the bladder may not empty completely when urinating. Bacteria can build up in the bladder and kidneys, causing urinary tract infections. Nerve damage can also affect the ability to feel the need to urinate or to control the muscles that release urine, leading to leakage (incontinence).\n- Sharp drops in blood pressure. Damage to the nerves that control blood flow can affect the body's ability to adjust blood pressure. This can cause a sharp drop in pressure when standing after sitting or lying down, which may lead to lightheadedness and fainting.\n- Digestive problems. If nerve damage occurs in the digestive tract, constipation or diarrhea, or both are possible. Diabetes-related nerve damage can lead to gastroparesis, a condition in which the stomach empties too slowly or not at all. This can cause bloating and indigestion.\n- Sexual dysfunction. Autonomic neuropathy often damages the nerves that affect the sex organs. Men may experience erectile dysfunction. Women may have difficulty with lubrication and arousal.\n- Increased or decreased sweating. Nerve damage can disrupt how the sweat glands work and make it difficult for the body to control its temperature properly.\nPrevention\nYou can prevent or delay diabetic neuropathy and its complications by closely managing your blood sugar and taking good care of your feet.\nBlood sugar management\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people living with diabetes have a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test at least twice a year. This test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past 2 to 3 months.\nglycated hemoglobin (A1C) goals may need to be individualized, but for many adults, the ADA recommends an A1C of less than 7.0%. If your blood sugar levels are higher than your goal, you may need changes in your daily management, such as adding or adjusting your medications or changing your diet or physical activity.\nFoot care\nFoot problems, including sores that don't heal, ulcers and even amputation, are common complications of diabetic neuropathy. But you can prevent many of these problems by having a thorough foot exam at least once a year. Also have your health care provider check your feet at each office visit and take good care of your feet at home.\nFollow your health care provider's recommendations for good foot care. To protect the health of your feet:\n- Check your feet every day. Look for blisters, cuts, bruises, cracked and peeling skin, redness, and swelling. Use a mirror or ask a friend or family member to help examine parts of your feet that are hard to see.\n- Keep your feet clean and dry. Wash your feet every day with lukewarm water and mild soap. Don't soak your feet. Dry your feet and between your toes thoroughly.\n- Moisturize your feet. This helps prevent cracking. But don't get lotion between your toes because it might encourage fungal growth.\n- Trim your toenails carefully. Cut your toenails straight across. File the edges carefully so that you have smooth edges. If you can't do this yourself, a specialist in foot problems (podiatrist) can help.\n- Wear clean, dry socks. Look for socks made of cotton or moisture-wicking fibers that don't have tight bands or thick seams.\n- Wear cushioned shoes that fit well. Wear closed-toed shoes or slippers to protect your feet. Make sure your shoes fit properly and allow your toes to move. A foot specialist can teach you how to buy properly fitted shoes and to prevent problems such as corns and calluses. If you qualify for Medicare, your plan may cover the cost of at least one pair of shoes each year.",

It's also called diabetic kidney disease. In the United States, about 1 in 3 people living with diabetes have diabetic nephropathy.\nDiabetic nephropathy affects the kidneys' usual work of removing waste products and extra fluid from the body. The best way to prevent or delay diabetic nephropathy is by living a healthy lifestyle and keeping diabetes and high blood pressure managed.\nOver years, diabetic nephropathy slowly damages the kidneys' filtering system. Early treatment may prevent this condition or slow it and lower the chance of complications.\nDiabetic kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. This also is called end-stage kidney disease. Kidney failure is a life-threatening condition. Treatment options for kidney failure are dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nOne of the important jobs of the kidneys is to clean the blood. As blood moves through the body, it picks up extra fluid, chemicals and waste. The kidneys separate this material from the blood. It's carried out of the body in urine. If the kidneys are unable to do this and the condition is untreated, serious health problems result, with eventual loss of life.\nMayo Clinic Health Letter & Books\nJoin thousands of readers who trust Mayo Clinic Health Letter for reliable health tips and insights. Start your journey to better health today.\nProducts & Services\nSymptoms\nIn the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, there might not be symptoms. In later stages, symptoms may include:\n- High blood pressure that gets harder to control.\n- Swelling of feet, ankles, hands or eyes.\n- Foamy urine.\n- Confusion or difficulty thinking.\n- Shortness of breath.\n- Loss of appetite.\n- Nausea and vomiting.\n- Itching.\n- Tiredness and weakness.\nWhen to see a doctor\nMake an appointment with your health care professional if you have symptoms of kidney disease. If you have diabetes, visit your health care professional yearly or as often as you're told for tests that measure how well your kidneys are working.\nCauses\nDiabetic nephropathy happens when diabetes damages blood vessels and other cells in the kidneys.\nHow the kidneys work\nHealthy kidney vs. diseased kidney\nHealthy kidney vs. diseased kidney\nA typical kidney has about 1 million filtering units. Each unit, called a glomerulus, joins a tubule. The tubule collects urine. Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes harm kidney function by damaging these filtering units and tubules. The damage causes scarring.\nKidney cross section\nKidney cross section\nThe kidneys remove waste and extra fluid from the blood through filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron contains a filter, called a glomerulus. Each filter has tiny blood vessels called capillaries. When blood flows into a glomerulus, tiny bits, called molecules, of water, minerals and nutrients, and wastes pass through the capillary walls. Large molecules, such as proteins and red blood cells, do not. The part that's filtered then passes into another part of the nephron called the tubule. The water, nutrients and minerals the body needs are sent back to the bloodstream. The extra water and waste become urine that flows to the bladder.\nThe kidneys have millions of tiny blood vessel clusters called glomeruli. Glomeruli filter waste from the blood. Damage to these blood vessels can lead to diabetic nephropathy. The damage can keep the kidneys from working as they should and lead to kidney failure.\nDiabetic nephropathy causes\nDiabetic nephropathy is a common complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nOver time, diabetes that isn't well controlled can damage blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. This can lead to kidney damage and cause high blood pressure.\nHigh blood pressure can cause more kidney damage by raising the pressure in the filtering system of the kidneys.\nRisk factors\nIf you have diabetes, the following can raise your risk of diabetic nephropathy:\n- Uncontrolled high blood sugar, also called hyperglycemia.\n- Uncontrolled high blood pressure, also called hypertension.\n- Smoking.\n- High blood cholesterol.\n- Obesity.\n- A family history of diabetes and kidney disease.\nComplications\nComplications of diabetic nephropathy can come on slowly over months or years. They may include:\n- Body fluid buildup. This could lead to swelling in the arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in the lungs, called pulmonary edema.\n- A rise in the levels of the mineral potassium in the blood, called hyperkalemia.\n- Heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease. This could lead to a stroke.\n- Fewer red blood cells to carry oxygen. This condition also is called anemia.\n- Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the pregnant person and the growing fetus.\n- Damage to the kidneys that can't be fixed. This is called end-stage kidney disease. Treatment is either dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nPrevention\nTo lower your risk of developing diabetic nephropathy:\n- See your health care team regularly to manage diabetes. Keep appointments to check on how well you are managing your diabetes and to check for diabetic nephropathy and other complications. Your appointments might be yearly or more often.\n- Treat your diabetes. With good treatment of diabetes, you can keep your blood sugar levels in the target range as much as possible. This may prevent or slow diabetic nephropathy.\n- Manage high blood pressure or other medical conditions. If you have high blood pressure or other conditions that raise your risk of kidney disease, work with your health care professional to control them.\n- Take medicines you get without a prescription only as directed. Read the labels on the pain relievers you take. This might include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). For people with diabetic nephropathy, these types of pain relievers can lead to kidney damage.\n- Stay at a healthy weight. If you're at a healthy weight, work to stay that way by being physically active most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, talk with a member of your health care team about the best way for you to lose weight.\n- Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking can damage kidneys or make kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker, talk to a member of your health care team about ways to quit. Support groups, counseling and some medicines might help.\nOct. 24, 2023",
            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371611": "Overview\nDiabetic retinopathy (die-uh-BET-ik ret-ih-NOP-uh-thee) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).\nAt first, diabetic retinopathy might cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. But it can lead to blindness.\nThe condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.\nSymptoms\nYou might not have symptoms in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. As the condition progresses, you might develop:\n- Spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters)\n- Blurred vision\n- Fluctuating vision\n- Dark or empty areas in your vision\n- Vision loss\nWhen to see an eye doctor\nCareful management of your diabetes is the best way to prevent vision loss. If you have diabetes, see your eye doctor for a yearly eye exam with dilation \u2014 even if your vision seems fine.\nDeveloping diabetes when pregnant (gestational diabetes) or having diabetes before becoming pregnant can increase your risk of diabetic retinopathy. If you're pregnant, your eye doctor might recommend additional eye exams throughout your pregnancy.\nContact your eye doctor right away if your vision changes suddenly or becomes blurry, spotty or hazy.\nCauses\nOver time, too much sugar in your blood can lead to the blockage of the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina, cutting off its blood supply. As a result, the eye attempts to grow new blood vessels. But these new blood vessels don't develop properly and can leak easily.\nThere are two types of diabetic retinopathy:\n-\nEarly diabetic retinopathy. In this more common form \u2014 called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) \u2014 new blood vessels aren't growing (proliferating).\nWhen you have nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken. Tiny bulges protrude from the walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid and blood into the retina. Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter as well. NPDR can progress from mild to severe as more blood vessels become blocked.\nSometimes retinal blood vessel damage leads to a buildup of fluid (edema) in the center portion (macula) of the retina. If macular edema decreases vision, treatment is required to prevent permanent vision loss.\n-\nAdvanced diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy can progress to this more severe type, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina. These new blood vessels are fragile and can leak into the clear, jellylike substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous).\nEventually, scar tissue from the growth of new blood vessels can cause the retina to detach from the back of your eye. If the new blood vessels interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, pressure can build in the eyeball. This buildup can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve), resulting in glaucoma.\nDiabetic retinopathy\nRisk factors\nAnyone who has diabetes can develop diabetic retinopathy. The risk of developing the eye condition can increase as a result of:\n- Having diabetes for a long time\n- Poor control of your blood sugar level\n- High blood pressure\n- High cholesterol\n- Pregnancy\n- Tobacco use\n- Being Black, Hispanic or Native American\nComplications\nDiabetic retinopathy involves the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Complications can lead to serious vision problems:\n-\nVitreous hemorrhage. The new blood vessels may bleed into the clear, jellylike substance that fills the center of your eye. If the amount of bleeding is small, you might see only a few dark spots (floaters). In more-severe cases, blood can fill the vitreous cavity and completely block your vision.\nVitreous hemorrhage by itself usually doesn't cause permanent vision loss. The blood often clears from the eye within a few weeks or months. Unless your retina is damaged, your vision will likely return to its previous clarity.\n- Retinal detachment. The abnormal blood vessels associated with diabetic retinopathy stimulate the growth of scar tissue, which can pull the retina away from the back of the eye. This can cause spots floating in your vision, flashes of light or severe vision loss.\n- Glaucoma. New blood vessels can grow in the front part of your eye (iris) and interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, causing pressure in the eye to build. This pressure can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve).\n- Blindness. Diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, glaucoma or a combination of these conditions can lead to complete vision loss, especially if the conditions are poorly managed.\nPrevention\nYou can't always prevent diabetic retinopathy. However, regular eye exams, good control of your blood sugar and blood pressure, and early intervention for vision problems can help prevent severe vision loss.\nIf you have diabetes, reduce your risk of getting diabetic retinopathy by doing the following:\n- Manage your diabetes. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as walking, each week. Take oral diabetes medications or insulin as directed.\n- Monitor your blood sugar level. You might need to check and record your blood sugar level several times a day \u2014 or more frequently if you're ill or under stress. Ask your doctor how often you need to test your blood sugar.\n- Ask your doctor about a glycosylated hemoglobin test. The glycosylated hemoglobin test, or hemoglobin A1C test, reflects your average blood sugar level for the two- to three-month period before the test. For most people with diabetes, the A1C goal is to be under 7%.\n- Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. Eating healthy foods, exercising regularly and losing excess weight can help. Sometimes medication is needed, too.\n- If you smoke or use other types of tobacco, ask your doctor to help you quit. Smoking increases your risk of various diabetes complications, including diabetic retinopathy.\n- Pay attention to vision changes. Contact your eye doctor right away if your vision suddenly changes or becomes blurry, spotty or hazy.\nRemember, diabetes doesn't necessarily lead to vision loss. Taking an active role in diabetes management can go a long way toward preventing complications.",
            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447": "Overview\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink.\nAbout 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease.\nEarly symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks.\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. These complications can result in death.\nBut medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers.\nProducts & Services\nSymptoms\nMemory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur.\nAt first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As signs and symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues.\nBrain changes from Alzheimer's disease lead to the following symptoms that get worse over time.\nMemory\nEveryone has trouble with memory at times, but the memory loss related to Alzheimer's disease is lasting. Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work and at home.\nPeople with Alzheimer's disease may:\n- Repeat statements and questions over and over.\n- Forget conversations, appointments or events.\n- Misplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense.\n- Get lost in places they used to know well.\n- Forget the names of family members and everyday objects.\n- Have trouble finding the right words, expressing thoughts or having conversations.\nThinking and reasoning\nAlzheimer's disease causes trouble concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Doing more than one task at once is especially hard. It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually people with Alzheimer's disease may not recognize numbers.\nMaking judgments and decisions\nAlzheimer's disease makes it hard to make sensible decisions and judgments. People with Alzheimer's disease may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather. Everyday problems may be hard to solve. Someone with Alzheimer's disease may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or how to make decisions when driving.\nPlanning and performing familiar tasks\nRoutine activities that involve completing steps in a certain order also can be hard for people with Alzheimer's disease. They may have trouble planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. As Alzheimer's disease becomes advanced, people forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing.\nChanges in personality and behavior\nBrain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Symptoms may include:\n- Depression.\n- Loss of interest in activities.\n- Social withdrawal.\n- Mood swings.\n- Not trusting others.\n- Anger or aggression.\n- Changes in sleeping habits.\n- Wandering.\n- Loss of inhibitions.\n- Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen when it hasn't.\nPreserved skills\nDespite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to keep some skills even as symptoms get worse. These are known as preserved skills. They may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts.\nPreserved skills may last longer because they're managed by parts of the brain affected in later stages of the disease.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSeveral conditions can cause memory loss or other dementia symptoms. Some of those conditions can be treated. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your healthcare professional.\nIf you are concerned about the thinking skills you notice in a family member or friend, ask about going together to talk to a healthcare professional.\nMore Information\nCauses\nHealthy brain and brain with Alzheimer's disease\nHealthy brain and brain with Alzheimer's disease\nIn the brain of someone with Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaques form and tau proteins change shape and become tangles.\nThe exact causes of Alzheimer's disease aren't fully understood. But at a basic level, brain proteins don't function as usual. This disrupts the work of brain cells, also known as neurons, and triggers a series of events. The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other. They eventually die.\nScientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. In less than 1% of people, Alzheimer's is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease. For people in this group, the disease usually begins in middle age.\nThe disease begins years before the first symptoms. The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that manages memory. The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brain. By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk.\nResearchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer's disease are focused on the role of two proteins:\n- Plaques. Beta-amyloid is a fragment of a larger protein. When these fragments clump together, they affect communication between brain cells. The clumps form larger deposits called amyloid plaques.\n- Tangles. Tau proteins play a part in a brain cell's internal support and transport system to carry nutrients and other essential materials. In Alzheimer's disease, tau proteins change mshape and organize into structures called neurofibrillary tangles. The tangles disrupt the transport system and cause damage to cells.\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for Alzheimer's disease include age, family history, lifestyle and other factors.\nOlder age\nOlder age is the strongest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's isn't a part of typical aging. But as you grow older, the chances of getting the disease goes up.\nOne study found that there were four new diagnoses per 1,000 people ages 65 to 74 every year. Among people ages 75 to 84, there were 32 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. For those 85 and older, there were 76 new diagnoses per 1,000 people.\nFamily history and genetics\nThe risk of getting Alzheimer's disease is higher if a first-degree relative such as a parent or sibling was diagnosed with the disease. How genes among families affect the risk is largely not understood. The genetic factors are likely complex.\nA better understood genetic factor is a form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Having the form of the gene known as APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. About 25% to 30% of the population carries APOE e4. But not everyone with this form of the gene develops the disease. Having two copies of APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease more than having one copy.\nScientists have found rare changes in three genes that virtually guarantee a person who inherits one of them will develop Alzheimer's. But these changes account for less than 1% of people with Alzheimer's disease.\nDown syndrome\nMany people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease. This is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 21. Chromosome 21 is the gene involved in the production of the protein that leads to the creation of beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid fragments can become plaques in the brain. Symptoms tend to appear 10 to 20 years earlier in people with Down syndrome than they do for the general population.\nSex assigned at birth\nOverall there are more women with the disease because they tend to live longer than men.\nMild cognitive impairment\nSomeone with mild cognitive impairment, also called MCI, has a bigger decline in memory or other thinking skills than is usual for the person's age. But the decline doesn't prevent the person from functioning at work or socially.\nHowever, people with MCI have a higher risk of getting dementia than are people who don't have mild cognitive impairment. When MCI affects mainly memory, the condition is more likely to progress to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. A diagnosis of MCI offers people the chance to focus on healthy lifestyle changes and to come up with strategies to make up for memory loss. They also can schedule regular healthcare appointments to monitor symptoms.\nHead injury\nSeveral large studies found that people age 50 or older who had a traumatic brain injury, also called TBI, had a higher risk of getting dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The risk is even higher in people with serious TBIs or multiple TBIs.\nAir pollution\nStudies in animals have found that air pollution particulates can speed the breakdown of the nervous system. Human studies have found that air pollution exposure \u2014 especially from traffic exhaust and burning wood \u2014 is linked to a higher risk of dementia.\nHeavy alcohol use\nDrinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol misuse is linked to a higher risk of dementia, especially early-onset dementia.\nPoor sleep patterns\nResearch has shown that poor sleep patterns, such as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, are linked to a raised risk of Alzheimer's disease. Sleep apnea also may raise the risk of dementia.\nLifestyle and heart health\nResearch has shown that the same risk factors for heart disease also may increase the risk of dementia. It's not clear if these factors raise risk by worsening Alzheimer's changes in the brain or by leading to blood vessel changes in the brain. The factors include:\n- Lack of exercise.\n- Obesity.\n- Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.\n- High blood pressure.\n- High cholesterol.\n- Poorly managed type 2 diabetes.\nHigh levels of low-density lipoprotein, known as LDL, cholesterol in middle age, in particular, raises the risk of dementia. Research has found that people younger than 65 with high LDL cholesterol levels have a higher risk of dementia. But taking medicines to lower LDL cholesterol didn't raise the risk.\nThese factors can all be modified, so changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk. For example, regular exercise and a healthy low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are related to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.\nHearing loss\nStudies have found that people who have hearing loss are at risk of dementia. The worse the hearing loss, the higher the risk. However, wearing hearing aids protects against getting dementia.\nVision loss that is not treated\nNewer research suggests vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. The link may be due to a disease such as diabetes that can increase the risk of both vision loss and dementia. But some research suggests vision loss itself may increase the risk of dementia.\nLifelong learning and social engagement\nStudies have found that being social and doing activities that stimulate the mind throughout life can lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Low education levels \u2014 less than a high school education \u2014 appear to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.\nComplications\nAlzheimer's disease can lead to a variety of complications. Symptoms such as memory loss, language loss, impaired judgment and other brain changes can make it harder to manage other health conditions. A person with Alzheimer's disease may not be able to:\n- Tell someone about being in pain.\n- Explain symptoms of another illness.\n- Follow a treatment plan.\n- Explain medicine side effects.\nAs Alzheimer's disease moves into its last stages, brain changes begin to affect physical functions. The changes can affect the ability to swallow, balance, and manage stool and bladder movements. These effects can lead to other health issues such as:\n- Inhaling food or liquid into the lungs.\n- Flu, pneumonia and other infections.\n- Falls.\n- Fractures.\n- Bedsores.\n- Poor nutrition or dehydration.\n- Constipation or diarrhea.\nPrevention\nAlzheimer's disease can't be prevented. But making lifestyle changes can lower your risk of getting the disease.\nResearch suggests that taking steps that lower your risk of cardiovascular disease may reduce the risk of dementia, as well. To follow heart-healthy lifestyle choices that may lower the risk of dementia:\n- Exercise regularly.\n- Eat a diet of fresh produce, healthy oils and foods low in saturated fat, such as a Mediterranean diet.\n- Work with your healthcare professional to manage high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. Pay particular attention to your levels of low-density lipoprotein, known as LDL, cholesterol. High levels of LDL cholesterol in people younger than 65 raises the risk of dementia. But taking medicines to lower LDL cholesterol doesn't raise the risk.\n- If you smoke, ask your healthcare professional for help to quit.\nOne large, long-term study done in Finland found that making lifestyle changes helped reduce cognitive decline among people who were at risk of dementia. Those in the study were given individual and group sessions that focused on diet, exercise and social activities.\nSeveral studies have found that following a Mediterranean diet leads to better cognitive function and a slower cognitive decline with age. A Mediterranean diet focuses on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, fish, poultry, nuts and olive oil. The diet includes less foods that are high in saturated fats and trans fats, such as butter, margarine, cheese, red meat, fried food and pastries.\nIt's also important to treat vision loss and hearing loss. Studies have found that vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. Studies also have found that people who have hearing loss are at higher risk of dementia. But wearing hearing aids made people less likely to get dementia.\nOther studies have shown that staying engaged mentally and socially is linked to preserved thinking skills later in life and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. This includes going to social events, reading, dancing, playing board games, creating art, playing an instrument and other activities.\nNov. 08, 2024",

            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745": "Overview\nPreeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy. With preeclampsia, you might have high blood pressure, high levels of protein in urine that indicate kidney damage (proteinuria), or other signs of organ damage. Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had previously been in the standard range.\nLeft untreated, preeclampsia can lead to serious \u2014 even fatal \u2014 complications for both the mother and baby.\nEarly delivery of the baby is often recommended. The timing of delivery depends on how severe the preeclampsia is and how many weeks pregnant you are. Before delivery, preeclampsia treatment includes careful monitoring and medications to lower blood pressure and manage complications.\nPreeclampsia may develop after delivery of a baby, a condition known as postpartum preeclampsia.\nSymptoms\nThe defining feature of preeclampsia is high blood pressure, proteinuria, or other signs of damage to the kidneys or other organs. You may have no noticeable symptoms. The first signs of preeclampsia are often detected during routine prenatal visits with a health care provider.\nAlong with high blood pressure, preeclampsia signs and symptoms may include:\n- Excess protein in urine (proteinuria) or other signs of kidney problems\n- Decreased levels of platelets in blood (thrombocytopenia)\n- Increased liver enzymes that indicate liver problems\n- Severe headaches\n- Changes in vision, including temporary loss of vision, blurred vision or light sensitivity\n- Shortness of breath, caused by fluid in the lungs\n- Pain in the upper belly, usually under the ribs on the right side\n- Nausea or vomiting\nWeight gain and swelling (edema) are typical during healthy pregnancies. However, sudden weight gain or a sudden appearance of edema \u2014 particularly in your face and hands \u2014 may be a sign of preeclampsia.\nWhen to see a doctor\nMake sure you attend your prenatal visits so that your health care provider can monitor your blood pressure. Contact your provider immediately or go to an emergency room if you have severe headaches, blurred vision or other visual disturbances, severe belly pain, or severe shortness of breath.\nBecause headaches, nausea, and aches and pains are common pregnancy complaints, it's difficult to know when new symptoms are simply part of being pregnant and when they may indicate a serious problem \u2014 especially if it's your first pregnancy. If you're concerned about your symptoms, contact your doctor.\nFrom Mayo Clinic to your inbox\nCauses\nThe exact cause of preeclampsia likely involves several factors. Experts believe it begins in the placenta \u2014 the organ that nourishes the fetus throughout pregnancy. Early in a pregnancy, new blood vessels develop and evolve to supply oxygen and nutrients to the placenta.\nIn women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don't seem to develop or work properly. Problems with how well blood circulates in the placenta may lead to the irregular regulation of blood pressure in the mother.\nOther high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy\nPreeclampsia is one high blood pressure (hypertension) disorder that can occur during pregnancy. Other disorders can happen, too:\n- Gestational hypertension is high blood pressure that begins after 20 weeks without problems in the kidneys or other organs. Some women with gestational hypertension may develop preeclampsia.\n- Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy or that occurs before 20 weeks of pregnancy. High blood pressure that continues more than three months after a pregnancy also is called chronic hypertension.\n- Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia occurs in women diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure before pregnancy, who then develop worsening high blood pressure and protein in the urine or other health complications during pregnancy.\nRisk factors\nConditions that are linked to a higher risk of preeclampsia include:\n- Preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy\n- Being pregnant with more than one baby\n- Chronic high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- Type 1 or type 2 diabetes before pregnancy\n- Kidney disease\n- Autoimmune disorders\n- Use of in vitro fertilization\nConditions that are associated with a moderate risk of developing preeclampsia include:\n- First pregnancy with current partner\n- Obesity\n- Family history of preeclampsia\n- Maternal age of 35 or older\n- Complications in a previous pregnancy\n- More than 10 years since previous pregnancy\nOther risk factors\nSeveral studies have shown a greater risk of preeclampsia among Black women compared with other women. There's also some evidence of an increased risk among indigenous women in North America.\nA growing body of evidence suggests that these differences in risk may not necessarily be based on biology. A greater risk may be related to inequities in access to prenatal care and health care in general, as well as social inequities and chronic stressors that affect health and well-being.\nLower income also is associated with a greater risk of preeclampsia likely because of access to health care and social factors affecting health.\nFor the purposes of making decisions about prevention strategies, a Black woman or a woman with a low income has a moderately increased risk of developing preeclampsia.\nComplications\nComplications of preeclampsia may include:\n- Fetal growth restriction. Preeclampsia affects the arteries carrying blood to the placenta. If the placenta doesn't get enough blood, the baby may receive inadequate blood and oxygen and fewer nutrients. This can lead to slow growth known as fetal growth restriction.\n- Preterm birth. Preeclampsia may lead to an unplanned preterm birth \u2014 delivery before 37 weeks. Also, planned preterm birth is a primary treatment for preeclampsia. A baby born prematurely has increased risk of breathing and feeding difficulties, vision or hearing problems, developmental delays, and cerebral palsy. Treatments before preterm delivery may decrease some risks.\n- Placental abruption. Preeclampsia increases your risk of placental abruption. With this condition, the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery. Severe abruption can cause heavy bleeding, which can be life-threatening for both the mother and baby.\n-\nhemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. HELLP stands for hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count. This severe form of preeclampsia affects several organ systems. HELLP syndrome is life-threatening to the mother and baby, and it may cause lifelong health problems for the mother.\nSigns and symptoms include nausea and vomiting, headache, upper right belly pain, and a general feeling of illness or being unwell. Sometimes, it develops suddenly, even before high blood pressure is detected. It also may develop without any symptoms.\n-\nEclampsia. Eclampsia is the onset of seizures or coma with signs or symptoms of preeclampsia. It is very difficult to predict whether a patient with preeclampsia will develop eclampsia. Eclampsia can happen without any previously observed signs or symptoms of preeclampsia.\nSigns and symptoms that may appear before seizures include severe headaches, vision problems, mental confusion or altered behaviors. But, there are often no symptoms or warning signs. Eclampsia may occur before, during or after delivery.\n- Other organ damage. Preeclampsia may result in damage to the kidneys, liver, lung, heart, or eyes, and may cause a stroke or other brain injury. The amount of injury to other organs depends on how severe the preeclampsia is.\n- Cardiovascular disease. Having preeclampsia may increase your risk of future heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. The risk is even greater if you've had preeclampsia more than once or you've had a preterm delivery.\nPrevention\nMedication\nThe best clinical evidence for prevention of preeclampsia is the use of low-dose aspirin. Your primary care provider may recommend taking an 81-milligram aspirin tablet daily after 12 weeks of pregnancy if you have one high-risk factor for preeclampsia or more than one moderate-risk factor.\nIt's important that you talk with your provider before taking any medications, vitamins or supplements to make sure it's safe for you.\nLifestyle and healthy choices\nBefore you become pregnant, especially if you've had preeclampsia before, it's a good idea to be as healthy as you can be. Talk to your provider about managing any conditions that increase the risk of preeclampsia.",

The content development process includes contributions from multiple disciplines: For this reason, editorial staff members do not receive bylines.\nHealth information process\nHealth information on this website is created using a standard process. The process includes editorial research, writing and editing, medical review, copy editing, annotation, visual content creation, and publishing.\nNew topics\nEditorial staff determine new health information topics using a variety of inputs. This includes medical editors and other Mayo colleagues. Editorial staff and medical editors make final decisions on new topics. Priority is given to topics of interest to the general public and Mayo Clinic patients.\nUpdates\nJust as medicine evolves, so does health information. For this reason, all published health information is on a review schedule. Faster-evolving topics \u2014 diseases, conditions, diagnostic tests and medical procedures \u2014 are reviewed at least every two years. Reviews focus on medical accuracy, relevance and supporting evidence. Editorial staff and medical editors closely check evidence-based guidelines in their assigned topic areas. This and other new information that may require revisions before the next scheduled review. When criteria are met, some revisions are processed as a critical update and republished as quickly as possible. Health information review and publishing dates are posted for transparency. Health information is annually checked for accuracy, redundancy and reader engagement. Content may be archived if it is considered out of date, redundant or has low engagement.\nEditorial research\nTo ensure accuracy and reliability, editorial staff follow a standardized procedure for selecting, documenting and verifying best-available medical evidence to support original content. Not all scientific evidence is of equal value or strength, so sources are defined and categorized. Health information writers use the strongest sources. These include national and international guidelines, consensus statements, evidence-based databases and peer-reviewed journals. Editorial staff consult with Mayo Clinic experts to help interpret and apply that evidence. Mayo medical specialists also are cited as expert sources. A team of editorial research librarians helps with these activities. Librarians have advanced degrees in the library sciences and a minimum of two years of relevant experience.\nWriting and editing\nEditorial staff write and edit content to adhere to these and other best practices:\n- Plain language. Text is written to be understood the first time it's read. We aim for a reading level between 6th and 8th grade.\n- Editorial style. Content is reviewed for grammar, spelling, punctuation, style, format, term use, clarity and consistency. We generally follow Associated Press style.\n- Tone and voice. We use a conversational writing style that is both authoritative and compassionate.\nMedical review\nMedical editors review health information for accuracy, timeliness and relevance and sources consulted. Medical editors may consult with other experts to ensure that statements are based on the best-available evidence and expert consensus.\nAnnotation\nHealth information is reviewed by an ontology specialist. Descriptive metadata, such as subject and audience, is added to the content. Descriptive metadata supports the management, organization, delivery and findability of health information.\nVisual content creation\nA team of specialized staff members creates visual health information, including:\n- Editorial or instructional illustrations. Illustrations and images teach or support content concepts. They do not require specialized training in medicine and anatomy.\n- Medical illustrations and animations. Custom visuals communicate complex medical or anatomical information. They are created by certified professional medical illustrators or animators.\n- Video and animations. Multimedia assets combine live action, text or image animation, and sound to educate and inform.\nContent translations\nA team of content linguists translates English language health information created by editorial staff to three target languages: Arabic, Simplified Chinese and Spanish. Content linguists also review the translations of external language service providers to ensure that they meet Mayo's high standards. Standards include glossaries and quality-assurance processes to ensure that translations are correct, readable, clear and consistent. Linguists have advanced degrees in foreign languages, journalism and communications fields, and at least five years of relevant experience.\nExternal links and social media\nAs a service to readers, we include some links to external websites and social media outlets. External links are identified and evaluated as part of the content development process.\nEditorial staff may choose to link to an external website if it meets these criteria:\n- The site provides unbiased, high-quality information that expands on the topic and isn't provided by another Mayo Clinic channel.\n- The site is determined to be credible and authoritative by our research librarians. These are typically government sites and sites of medical associations and other nonprofit medical groups.\nArtificial intelligence\nWe may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the development and translation of health information. For example, AI technology may help authors consistently write in plain language and choose words and images that are inclusive. AI tools also are used to optimize content for search applications and align with Mayo's preferred terminology, editorial style and target reading levels. Content linguists use context-intelligent software that automates storage and reuse of human-translated sentences and confirm quality. AI tools do not replace editorial judgment or oversight.\nCorrections\nEditorial staff are committed to correcting or clarifying published health information that is confusing, misleading or inaccurate. This determination is made by editorial staff in close consultation with medical editors. For transparency, corrections that involve misstatements of fact in health information are listed here for 30 days.\nAccreditations and awards\nHealth information on this website has been reviewed by independent evaluators for more than two decades. This has included Consumer Reports Web Watch guidelines, NewsGuard and the HONcode standard for trustworthy information, which ended its services in 2022.

The inventory includes clinics, hospitals, research facilities, educational facilities, administrative, power plants, parking ramps, healthy living, senior housing and warehousing. These facilities are managed locally within coordinated Mayo Clinic expectations.\nLocal management is focused on hub locations that include the following:\n- Mayo Clinic's campuses in Arizona (Phoenix and Scottsdale)\n- Mayo Clinic's campus in Florida (Jacksonville)\n- Mayo Clinic's campus in Minnesota (Rochester)\n- Mayo Clinic Health System \u2014 Northwest Wisconsin (Barron, Bloomer, Eau Claire, Menomonie and Osseo)\n- Mayo Clinic Health System \u2014 Southwest Wisconsin (La Crosse and Sparta)\n- Mayo Clinic Health System \u2014 Southeast Minnesota (Albert Lea, Austin, Cannon Falls, Lake City, Owatonna and Red Wing)\n- Mayo Clinic Health System \u2014 Southwest Minnesota (Fairmont, Mankato, New Prague, St. James, Springfield and Waseca)\nFacilities-related procurement recognizes the benefits of local suppliers and professionals for most facilities work. Specialized projects will generate the review of national resources. Ultimate selection and accountability lies with the project team or local leadership.\nFacilities construction-related and maintenance contracting philosophy\nMayo Clinic has developed design, construction, and service contract forms and agreements. The majority of routine work is accomplished through contract amendments to master agreements with established designers and contractors. Limited new relationships are pursued, due to the investment Mayo Clinic makes in developing external \"team members\" to its specific environment.\nSupplies procurement philosophy\nTo reduce overall nonconstruction supply expenses, Mayo Clinic actively leverages its purchasing volume by seeking agreements with suppliers in certain product and service categories to serve all Mayo Clinic facilities. Working with a group-purchasing organization, Mayo Clinic pursues national contracting opportunities that offer value to health care facilities in its system. This procurement is coordinated by Mayo Clinic Supply Chain Management.\nNew relationships\nIn compliance with expectations of the U.S. government, Mayo Clinic verifies service and product vendors to ensure they are legitimate companies. Verification utilizes an authentication process provided by PRGX Global Inc., which charges an authentication fee. This process allows a new contracted relationship to be established in our invoicing system and must be completed prior to submitting an invoice.\nAuthentication is important because it:\n- Is necessary to perform services at Mayo Clinic\n- Ensures appropriate 1099 reporting\n- Ensures appropriate tracking and use of minority suppliers\n- Limits access to your competitors that do not comply with requirements\nCompanies need an invitation email or letter containing the PRGX website address and a unique identification code, both of which are needed to begin the authentication process. Mayo Clinic staff will send you this invitation if services from your firm are requested.\nOnce logged in to the PRGX website, you will be asked to:\n- Complete a company profile, which includes entering your Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or federal Employer Identification Number (EIN)\n- Identify your company's principal party or owner\n- Upload documents, which vary depending on your business but may include Internal Revenue Service forms W-8 and W-9, your business license, and your minority-owned-business certificate\n- Pay an authentication fee by credit card",

This is especially true if your cancer is advanced or available treatments are unable to stop or slow its growth. Cancer clinical trials help physician-scientists test new and better ways to control and treat cancer. During a clinical trial, participants receive specific interventions, and researchers determine if those interventions are safe and effective. Interventions studied in clinical trials might be new cancer drugs or new combinations of drugs, new medical procedures, new surgical techniques or devices, new ways to use existing treatments, and lifestyle or behavior changes.

Join us and you'll find a culture of teamwork, professionalism and mutual respect, and most importantly, a life-changing career. Mayo Clinic was founded in Rochester, Minnesota by brothers Dr. William James Mayo and Dr. Charles Horace Mayo. More than 100 years later, their vision continues to evolve around a single guiding value: \"The needs of the patient come first.\" Today we are the largest integrated, not for-profit medical group practice in the world.

It's a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver, which can lead to inflammation, scarring and advanced liver disease. Patients with a body mass index of 40 are more likely to be denied a transplant due to their weight. Simultaneous bariatric surgery and liver transplant for patients who are severely obese is safe and improves long-term health outcomes, according to a recent Mayo Clinic study.

So, how do you keep track of which fats you're supposed to eat, and which you're supposed to avoid? This episode of On Nutrition, we're talking with Dr. Kyla Lara-Breitenger to untangle our notions of \"good\" and \"bad\" fats, demystify cholesterol, and embrace the tastiness\u2014and healthiness\u2014that fat can bring to our food. https://mayocl.in/4jK9yM4\n-\nDr. Paulo Casta\u00f1eda, head of the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit and Infectious Diseases Department at M\u00e9dica Sur, a Mayo Clinic Care Network member, recently visited Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

They\u2019ve stayed in touch ever since. \u201cWe correspond via phone or text a couple of times a year,\u201d says Cliff. Feeling grateful for his own health, Dr. Greene decided to become an altruistic living kidney donor. \u201cAfter lots of prayer, educating myself, and going through the evaluation process, I was delighted that I was approved to donate,\u201d he says. Right there beside him, after his surgery, was Cliff. Dr. Greene\u2019s message to others: \u201cMany people are kind and generous but may not realize they can save a life through living organ donation. If you\u2019re blessed with good health, consider sharing that blessing with others.\u201d Learn more about becoming a living donor: https://mayocl.in/4jEVioa",

But once we moved to Scottsdale we could not move our primary care doctor here to Mayo in that we were over 65. That was a low blow after being with Mayo in Rochester and having all of our medical care there for years. The other thing I find is that the Mayo system is difficult to navigate. Until you\u2019re the one doing all of the navigating you don\u2019t realize the difficulty involved. Because they do not take Medicare you have to pay the bills and never seem to match the payment schedule and so I put an XL spreadsheet together and put took it to the finance department. He told me that it is impossible to use the spreadsheet to figure out pay and even he had difficulty explaining it to me. That being said I still think it\u2019s the finest medical facility in Arizona but it certainly is difficult to navigate. On the website I find that if you request a response from the medical team you will get a quick response. I also find they telemedicine more and not being able to meet with doctors. I also find that PAs and MPs are meeting with you rather than doctors more often. I find them taking extraordinary Covid precautions and felt very safe once I got into the facility.\nonce reliable now bug ridden\nwith all the new design that you've done on this app and on the desktop version very little works right I am constantly kicked out of my session the choice of adding an appointment to any type of calendar results in the appointment being added to my calendar, and then disappearing not just occasionally, but every single time I cannot get questionnaires to load time after time after time that I need to fill out for appointments I cannot reach anybody on the phone because you have ridiculously long wait times because everybody's having trouble with the app. I don't know who was in charge of this revamp, but it's terrible. I worked in computer for 25 years, I know a poor revamp when I see one so my review is it's a very very bad app at this point in terms of reliability and people being able to get things done. What more is there to say the functionality that worked before is spotty it's confusing, trying to find the way around the app and again I have computer experience I'm not a novice it's hard to print things out so that they look clean and neat. I mean after all when you pay a couple thousand dollars to have a test done you expect to get a formal report that goes with that test that can follow you around and you can take the other practitionersreports to come off the way that they're set up the page breaking and the headers in the footers cut right the middle of lines of text that are important etc. etc. etc.\nSome features great and others poor\nThis app is very handy and i use it frequently. Like adding appointments to calendar feature. But both website and app neglect the ability to pay by visit selectively. This means bills get much later payment while some are pending on insurance payments...this is bad for Mayo cashflow.\nI might add that each time I have called and paid by specific visits the Mayo clerk agrees that they get many callers requesting to pay in this manner yet nothing has been done about it. One would think that the operating costs associated with phone support for billing in this manner (many times it can be 10+ minutes) would easily justify the changes to incorporated it. For example the website already lists the bills by visit number yet it does not provide the means to pay them individually. So this is just not an app problem.\nI suspect the problem is that they do accounting of charges and credits by an account and not by individual bills to an account. But since they go through the effort to address bills individually they should have the means to implement payment by bill(visits).\nDeveloper Response ,\nMatenai - thanks for the kind words about the app. I\u2019ve passed your feedback along to our billing area so they can consider improving that experience for users in the future.

            "https://www.mayoclinic.org/es/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444": "Descripci\u00f3n general\nLa diabetes mellitus se refiere a un grupo de enfermedades que afecta la forma en que el cuerpo utiliza la glucosa en la sangre. La glucosa es una importante fuente de energ\u00eda para las c\u00e9lulas que forman los m\u00fasculos y tejidos. Tambi\u00e9n es la principal fuente de combustible del cerebro.\nLa causa principal de la diabetes var\u00eda seg\u00fan el tipo. Pero, independientemente del tipo de diabetes que tengas, puede provocar un exceso de glucosa en la sangre. Demasiada glucosa en la sangre puede causar problemas de salud graves.\nLas afecciones de diabetes cr\u00f3nica comprenden diabetes tipo 1 y diabetes tipo 2. Las afecciones de diabetes potencialmente reversibles incluyen prediabetes y diabetes gestacional. La prediabetes ocurre cuando tus niveles de glucosa en la sangre son m\u00e1s elevados de lo normal. Pero esos niveles de glucosa en la sangre no son tan altos como para ser denominados diabetes. La prediabetes puede convertirse en diabetes, a no ser que se tomen medidas para prevenirla. La diabetes gestacional ocurre durante el embarazo, pero puede desaparecer despu\u00e9s de que el beb\u00e9 nace.\nProductos y servicios\nS\u00edntomas\nLos s\u00edntomas de la diabetes dependen del nivel de glucosa sangu\u00ednea. Es posible que algunas personas no presenten s\u00edntomas, especialmente si tienen prediabetes, diabetes gestacional o diabetes tipo 2. En el caso de la diabetes tipo 1, los s\u00edntomas tienden a aparecer r\u00e1pido y a ser m\u00e1s intensos.\nAlgunos de los s\u00edntomas de la diabetes tipo 1 y tipo 2 incluyen los siguientes:\n- M\u00e1s sed de lo habitual.\n- Micci\u00f3n frecuente.\n- P\u00e9rdida de peso involuntaria.\n- Presencia de cetonas en la orina. Las cetonas son un producto secundario de la descomposici\u00f3n de m\u00fasculo y grasa que ocurre cuando no hay suficiente insulina.\n- Sensaci\u00f3n de cansancio y debilidad.\n- Sensaci\u00f3n de irritabilidad u otros cambios en el estado de \u00e1nimo.\n- Visi\u00f3n borrosa.\n- Llagas que tardan en cicatrizar.\n- Infecciones frecuentes, como en las enc\u00edas, la piel o la vagina.\nSi bien la diabetes tipo 1 puede manifestarse a cualquier edad, suele ocurrir en la infancia o la adolescencia. La diabetes tipo 2, el tipo m\u00e1s com\u00fan, tambi\u00e9n puede manifestarse a cualquier edad, pero es m\u00e1s frecuente en personas mayores de 40 a\u00f1os. Sin embargo, est\u00e1n aumentando los casos de diabetes tipo 2 en ni\u00f1os.\nCu\u00e1ndo debes consultar con un m\u00e9dico\n- Si crees que t\u00fa o tu hijo tienen diabetes. Comun\u00edcate con el proveedor de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica si notas cualquier s\u00edntoma posible de diabetes. Cuanto antes se diagnostique la enfermedad, m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido puede comenzar el tratamiento.\n- Si ya te han diagnosticado diabetes. Despu\u00e9s de recibir el diagn\u00f3stico, necesitar\u00e1s un riguroso seguimiento m\u00e9dico hasta que tus niveles de glucosa en la sangre se estabilicen.\nCausas\nPara comprender la diabetes, es importante entender c\u00f3mo el cuerpo usa habitualmente la glucosa.\nC\u00f3mo funciona la insulina\nLa insulina es una hormona que proviene de una gl\u00e1ndula situada detr\u00e1s y debajo del est\u00f3mago (p\u00e1ncreas).\n- El p\u00e1ncreas libera insulina en el torrente sangu\u00edneo.\n- La insulina circula y permite que el az\u00facar entre en las c\u00e9lulas.\n- La insulina reduce la cantidad de az\u00facar presente en el torrente sangu\u00edneo.\n- A medida que el nivel de glucosa sangu\u00ednea baja, tambi\u00e9n lo hace la secreci\u00f3n de insulina del p\u00e1ncreas.\nLa funci\u00f3n de la glucosa\nLa glucosa, un tipo de az\u00facar, es la principal fuente de energ\u00eda de las c\u00e9lulas que forman los m\u00fasculos y otros tejidos.\n- La glucosa proviene de dos fuentes principales: los alimentos y el h\u00edgado.\n- La glucosa se absorbe en el torrente sangu\u00edneo, en donde ingresa en las c\u00e9lulas con la ayuda de la insulina.\n- El h\u00edgado elabora y almacena glucosa.\n- Cuando los niveles de glucosa son bajos, como cuando no has comido por un buen rato, el h\u00edgado convierte el gluc\u00f3geno almacenado en glucosa. As\u00ed mantiene tu nivel de glucosa dentro de un nivel normal.\nLa causa exacta de la mayor\u00eda de los tipos de diabetes se desconoce. En todos los casos, la glucosa se acumula en el torrente sangu\u00edneo. Esto se debe a que el p\u00e1ncreas no produce suficiente insulina. Ambas clases de diabetes, tipo 1 y tipo 2, pueden causarse por una combinaci\u00f3n de factores gen\u00e9ticos y ambientales. No se conoce realmente cu\u00e1les son estos factores.\nFactores de riesgo\nLos factores de riesgo para la diabetes dependen del tipo de diabetes que tienes. Los antecedentes familiares pueden desempe\u00f1ar un papel en todos los tipos. Los factores ambientales y la geograf\u00eda pueden aumentar el riesgo de padecer diabetes tipo 1.\nEn ocasiones, a los familiares de las personas con diabetes tipo 1 se les hacen an\u00e1lisis cl\u00ednicos para comprobar la presencia de c\u00e9lulas del sistema inmunitario de la diabetes (autoanticuerpos). Si tienes estos autoanticuerpos, tendr\u00e1s mayores probabilidades de padecer la enfermedad. Sin embargo, no todas las personas que tienen estos autoanticuerpos llegan a tener diabetes.\nLa raza o el origen \u00e9tnico tambi\u00e9n pueden aumentar el riesgo de presentar diabetes tipo 2. Aunque no se sabe con certeza el motivo, determinadas personas, como las afroamericanas, las hispanas, las ind\u00edgenas estadounidenses y las asi\u00e1ticas americanas, corren un mayor riesgo.\nLa prediabetes, la diabetes tipo 2 y la diabetes gestacional son m\u00e1s frecuentes en personas con sobrepeso u obesidad.\nComplicaciones\nLas complicaciones a largo plazo de la diabetes aparecen progresivamente. Cuanto m\u00e1s tiempo hayas tenido diabetes (y cuanto menos te hayas controlado la glucosa sangu\u00ednea), mayor ser\u00e1 el riesgo de sufrir complicaciones. Con el tiempo, las complicaciones de la diabetes podr\u00edan provocar discapacidad o incluso poner en riesgo la vida. De hecho, la prediabetes puede derivar en diabetes tipo 2. Algunas de las posibles complicaciones incluyen las siguientes:\n- Enfermedades card\u00edacas y de los vasos sangu\u00edneos (cardiovasculares). La diabetes aumenta en gran medida el riesgo de sufrir muchos problemas card\u00edacos. Entre ellos, se pueden incluir la enfermedad de las arterias coronarias con dolor de pecho (angina de pecho), ataque card\u00edaco, accidente cerebrovascular y estrechamiento de las arterias (ateroesclerosis). Si tienes diabetes, eres m\u00e1s propenso a desarrollar una enfermedad card\u00edaca o un accidente cerebrovascular.\n-\nDa\u00f1o a los nervios por diabetes (neuropat\u00eda diab\u00e9tica). El exceso de az\u00facar puede da\u00f1ar las paredes de los vasos sangu\u00edneos peque\u00f1os (capilares) que alimentan los nervios, especialmente en las piernas. Esto puede provocar hormigueo, entumecimiento, ardor o dolor, que generalmente comienza en las puntas de los dedos de los pies o las manos y se extiende progresivamente hacia arriba.\nEl da\u00f1o en los nervios relacionados con la digesti\u00f3n puede causar problemas de n\u00e1useas, v\u00f3mitos, diarrea o estre\u00f1imiento. En los hombres, puede derivar en disfunci\u00f3n er\u00e9ctil.\n- Da\u00f1o a los ri\u00f1ones por diabetes (nefropat\u00eda diab\u00e9tica). Los ri\u00f1ones contienen millones de peque\u00f1os grupos de vasos sangu\u00edneos (glom\u00e9rulos) que filtran los desechos de la sangre. La diabetes puede da\u00f1ar este delicado sistema de filtraci\u00f3n.\n- Da\u00f1o a los ojos por diabetes (retinopat\u00eda diab\u00e9tica). La diabetes puede da\u00f1ar los vasos sangu\u00edneos del ojo. Esto podr\u00eda derivar en ceguera.\n- Da\u00f1os en el pie. El da\u00f1o en los nervios de los pies o el flujo sangu\u00edneo insuficiente a los pies aumentan el riesgo de muchas complicaciones.\n- Afecciones de la piel y la boca. La diabetes puede hacer que seas m\u00e1s propenso a tener problemas de la piel, como infecciones bacterianas y mic\u00f3ticas.\n- Deterioro de la audici\u00f3n. Los problemas de audici\u00f3n son m\u00e1s frecuentes en las personas que tienen diabetes.\n- Enfermedad de Alzheimer. La diabetes tipo 2 puede aumentar el riesgo de demencia, como la enfermedad de Alzheimer.\n- Depresi\u00f3n relacionada con la diabetes. Los s\u00edntomas de depresi\u00f3n son comunes en personas con diabetes tipo 1 y tipo 2.\nComplicaciones de la diabetes gestacional\nLa mayor\u00eda de las mujeres con diabetes gestacional da a luz a beb\u00e9s sanos. No obstante, los niveles de glucosa en la sangre sin tratar o sin controlar pueden causarles problemas a ti y a tu beb\u00e9.\nLa diabetes gestacional puede provocar complicaciones en tu beb\u00e9, entre ellas:\n- Crecimiento excesivo. El exceso de glucosa puede atravesar la placenta. El exceso de glucosa provoca que el p\u00e1ncreas del beb\u00e9 produzca una cantidad excesiva de insulina. Como consecuencia, tu beb\u00e9 podr\u00eda crecer demasiado, lo que puede provocar dificultades en el parto o, en ocasiones, la necesidad de una ces\u00e1rea.\n- Nivel bajo de glucosa sangu\u00ednea. A veces, los beb\u00e9s de madres con diabetes gestacional tienen un nivel bajo de glucosa sangu\u00ednea (hipoglucemia) poco despu\u00e9s del nacimiento. Esto se debe a que su propia producci\u00f3n de insulina es elevada.\n- Diabetes tipo 2 en el futuro. Los beb\u00e9s de madres con diabetes gestacional tienen un mayor riesgo de padecer obesidad y diabetes tipo 2 en el futuro.\n- Muerte. Una diabetes gestacional no tratada puede provocar la muerte del beb\u00e9 antes o poco despu\u00e9s del parto.\nLa diabetes gestacional tambi\u00e9n puede provocar complicaciones en la madre, entre ellas:\n- Preeclampsia. Entre los s\u00edntomas de esta afecci\u00f3n se encuentran la presi\u00f3n arterial alta, el exceso de prote\u00ednas en la orina, y la hinchaz\u00f3n en las piernas y los pies.\n- Diabetes gestacional. Si tuviste diabetes gestacional en un embarazo, tienes m\u00e1s probabilidades de tenerla otra vez en el embarazo siguiente.\nPrevenci\u00f3n\nLa diabetes tipo 1 no puede prevenirse. Sin embargo, las mismas elecciones de estilo de vida saludable que ayudan a tratar la prediabetes, la diabetes tipo 2 y la diabetes gestacional tambi\u00e9n pueden ayudar a prevenirla:\n- Come alimentos saludables. Elige alimentos ricos en fibra, con bajo contenido graso y pocas calor\u00edas. C\u00e9ntrate en las frutas, las verduras y los granos integrales. Come variado para evitar el aburrimiento.\n- Haz m\u00e1s actividad f\u00edsica. Haz unos 30 minutos de actividad aer\u00f3bica moderada la mayor\u00eda de los d\u00edas de la semana. Intenta realizar al menos 150 minutos de actividad aer\u00f3bica moderada a la semana. Por ejemplo, puedes dar un paseo diario a paso ligero. Si no puedes realizar un entrenamiento prolongado, div\u00eddelo en sesiones m\u00e1s cortas durante el d\u00eda.\n-\nPierde el exceso de peso. Si tienes sobrepeso, bajar incluso el 7 % de tu peso corporal puede reducir el riesgo de tener diabetes. Por ejemplo, si pesas 200 libras (90,7 kilogramos), perder 14 libras (6,4 kilogramos) puede reducir el riesgo de diabetes.\nSin embargo, no intentes bajar de peso durante el embarazo. Consulta con tu proveedor de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica qu\u00e9 cantidad de peso es saludable que aumentes durante el embarazo.\nPara mantener tu peso en un rango saludable, c\u00e9ntrate en cambios a largo plazo en los h\u00e1bitos de alimentaci\u00f3n y de ejercicio. Recuerda los beneficios de perder peso, como tener un coraz\u00f3n m\u00e1s sano, m\u00e1s energ\u00eda y una mayor autoestima.\nA veces, los f\u00e1rmacos son una alternativa. Los f\u00e1rmacos orales para la diabetes, como la metformina (Glumetza, Fortamet y otros), pueden reducir el riesgo de diabetes tipo 2; sin embargo, la elecci\u00f3n de un estilo de vida saludable es importante. Si tienes prediabetes, haz que te controlen el nivel de glucosa sangu\u00ednea al menos una vez al a\u00f1o para comprobar que no tengas diabetes tipo 2.",

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/type-1-diabetes": "Type 1 Diabetes\nOn this page:\n- What is type 1 diabetes?\n- How common is type 1 diabetes?\n- Who is more likely to have type 1 diabetes?\n- What health problems can people with type 1 diabetes develop?\n- What are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes?\n- What causes type 1 diabetes?\n- How do health care professionals diagnose type 1 diabetes?\n- How can I manage type 1 diabetes?\n- Can I delay or prevent type 1 diabetes in me or in my family members who may be at risk?\n- Clinical Trials for Type 1 Diabetes\nWhat is type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes is a disease that occurs when your body makes little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps blood glucose, also called blood sugar, get into the body\u2019s cells to be used as energy. When your body doesn\u2019t have enough insulin, glucose in your blood can\u2019t get into the cells. As a result, your cells lack energy, your blood glucose level goes up, and you develop diabetes.\nA problem with the body\u2019s immune system causes type 1 diabetes. Your immune system normally fights infections. Type 1 diabetes develops when the body\u2019s immune system destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. When the immune system attacks healthy cells in your body, it\u2019s called autoimmunity. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease.\nMost people with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to manage their blood glucose level and stay alive. You may be able to prevent or delay health problems that can result from type 1 diabetes by learning to manage your blood glucose level, consuming healthy foods and drinks, and getting regular physical activity.\nHow common is type 1 diabetes?\nIn 2021, about 1.7 million U.S. adults ages 20 years or older\u2014or 5.7% of adults with diagnosed diabetes\u2014had type 1 diabetes and were taking insulin.1 Overall, 5% to 10% of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes.2\nThe number of young people with type 1 diabetes has been increasing over the last two decades. In 2021, about 304,000 children and teens younger than age 20 had type 1 diabetes.1\nWho is more likely to have type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes occurs more commonly in children and young adults, but it can develop at any age. Having a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes increases your chance of developing the disease. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes have the disease for the rest of their lives. Some people with type 1 diabetes can get a pancreatic islet or pancreas transplant and make insulin again. However, these transplants don\u2019t cure type 1 diabetes. People still need to take medicines called immunosuppressants to prevent the immune system from attacking and destroying the new islets or pancreas.\nType 1 diabetes is increasing among youth from certain racial and ethnic groups. However, new cases of type 1 diabetes are most common among White youth. Adults with diabetes who are younger than age 35 and have a healthy body weight are more likely to have type 1 diabetes than type 2 diabetes.2\nWhat health problems can people with type 1 diabetes develop?\nPeople with type 1 diabetes can develop the same diabetes health problems as people with other types of diabetes. High blood glucose levels from diabetes can damage many parts of your body, including your\n- heart\n- kidneys\n- nerves\n- eyes\n- feet\n- teeth\nPeople with diabetes may also have high blood pressure or cholesterol problems. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, managing your diabetes and having a healthy lifestyle may lower your chances of developing health problems.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nPeople with type 1 diabetes also have a higher risk of developing a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). When you have type 1 diabetes, your body doesn\u2019t have enough insulin to use blood glucose for energy. Your body will begin to use fat as a source of energy instead. This process produces substances called ketones. High levels of ketones can cause DKA. People have a higher risk of developing DKA when they have an infection or when they\u2019re under stress. DKA is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away.\nHypoglycemia unawareness\nSome people develop a serious condition called hypoglycemia unawareness. People with this condition don\u2019t feel their blood glucose level dropping, so they aren\u2019t aware they should treat low blood glucose, also called hypoglycemia.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you\u2019ll need to carefully manage the amount of insulin you take every day to keep your blood glucose level in a healthy range. If you take too much insulin, you may develop low blood glucose.\nHypoglycemia unawareness is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away. That\u2019s because hypoglycemia unawareness can cause problems with thinking and other brain functions and, if not treated, may lead to a coma.\nMental health conditions\nThe stress of managing type 1 diabetes can make some people more likely to develop sleep problems, anxiety, or depression. You may find it helpful to speak with a counselor or your primary health care professional about your mental health. Your primary health care professional may be a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner.\nOther health problems\nPeople with type 1 diabetes may also have a higher risk of other health problems, including\n- eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder\n- other autoimmune diseases\n- hip fractures in older adults due to osteoporosis\nIf you\u2019re pregnant and have diabetes, changes to your hormones may affect how your body uses insulin. Ask your health care professional if you should adjust your medicines during pregnancy to prevent health problems for you and your baby.\nWhat are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes?\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes may include\n- increased urination\n- feeling very thirsty\n- feeling very hungry, even after you\u2019ve eaten\n- blurred vision\n- fatigue\n- sores that don\u2019t heal\n- frequent infections, such as urinary tract infections, skin infections, or yeast infections\n- unexplained weight loss\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop quickly, over a few days or weeks. Children with type 1 diabetes typically develop symptoms over a short period of time. Common symptoms in children include\n- having to urinate more often\n- eating more but losing weight\n- feeling very thirsty\nThese symptoms are less common in adults with type 1 diabetes. For some adults, symptoms of type 1 diabetes may develop slowly and seem more like type 2 diabetes. Some adults who develop diabetes may need special tests to find out what type of diabetes they have.\nThe first symptoms of type 1 diabetes can be symptoms of DKA, especially in children. Symptoms of DKA include\n- feeling very tired\n- having trouble breathing\n- having fruity-smelling breath\n- fainting from dehydration\n- having pain in your abdomen, nausea, or vomiting\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes develops when the body\u2019s immune system destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. These cells are called beta cells. Genes and factors in the environment\u2014the place where people live, play, work, study, and gather\u2014may trigger the immune system to destroy beta cells in type 1 diabetes.\nStudies such as The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) are trying to learn more about the causes of type 1 diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet and other groups are working to find treatments that may prevent or slow the development of type 1 diabetes in people who are at risk for getting the disease.\nHow do health care professionals diagnose type 1 diabetes?\nYour health care professional can diagnose diabetes by reviewing your symptoms, asking about your medical history, and using diabetes tests. Your health care professional may also have you take diabetes tests to find out if your diabetes is type 1, type 2, or another type of diabetes. Your treatment will depend on the type of diabetes you have.\nHealth care professionals often test for type 1 diabetes in people who have common diabetes symptoms. Since type 1 diabetes can run in families, your health care professional may test you for type 1 diabetes if you have no symptoms but have a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes.\nBlood glucose tests\nHealth care professionals can diagnose diabetes using blood tests that measure your blood glucose level to see if it\u2019s higher than normal. Health care professionals may use\n- the random plasma glucose test to diagnose diabetes in people who have diabetes symptoms\n- the fasting plasma glucose test\n- the A1C test\nThe random plasma glucose test and fasting plasma glucose test measure your blood glucose level at the time your blood is drawn. The A1C test shows your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months.\nAlthough these blood glucose tests can help your health care professional tell if you have diabetes, the tests don\u2019t show the type of diabetes you have.\nAutoantibodies test\nTo find out if your diabetes is type 1, your health care professional may test your blood for certain autoantibodies.\nAutoantibodies and type 1 diabetes\nAutoantibodies are proteins made by your immune system that attack healthy tissues and cells by mistake. If you have certain autoantibodies in your blood, you may have type 1 diabetes.\nAutoantibodies and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults\nSome adults with diabetes have autoantibodies in their blood but develop symptoms slower than most people with type 1 diabetes. In this type of diabetes, your immune system damages your pancreas more slowly. You may not need to take insulin for several months after being diagnosed. This type of diabetes is sometimes called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).\nAutoantibodies and family members of people with type 1 diabetes\nIf you have a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes, your health care professional may suggest a test for autoantibodies, even if you don\u2019t have any symptoms. The test may show if you have a higher risk of developing symptoms of type 1 diabetes and if you should be treated to delay the disease. Talk with your health care professional about the symptoms of diabetes and ask if they want you to get more testing in the future.\nTrialNet is a research network that offers autoantibody testing to some family members of people with type 1 diabetes. Some people at risk of developing symptoms of type 1 diabetes may be able to participate in TrialNet studies.\nOther tests\nIf it\u2019s not clear what type of diabetes you have, your health care professional may ask you to do\n- a C-peptide test to see how much insulin your pancreas makes\n- genetic testing to rule out less common types of diabetes, such as monogenic diabetes\nHow can I manage type 1 diabetes?\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you\u2019ll need to take insulin to manage your blood glucose level. Using devices to check your blood glucose level and inject insulin may help keep your blood glucose level in a healthy range. Your health care professional may also prescribe other diabetes medicines.\nManaging your type 1 diabetes may help prevent or delay diabetes health problems.\nHaving a healthy lifestyle can help manage your type 1 diabetes and prevent other health problems. With the help of your health care team, you can create a diabetes care plan that works for you.\nInsulin and other diabetes medicines\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you need to take insulin to stay alive. Different types of insulin are available. Some types start to work quickly while others start to work more slowly. The effects of each type of insulin last for varying lengths of time. You may need to take more than one type of insulin. You can take insulin in a few ways, including\nIf you take insulin, you need to check your blood glucose level regularly. You should match your insulin dose with your food, physical activity, and current blood glucose level. If you don\u2019t, your blood glucose level may drop too low, which is called hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away.\nSome people have trouble managing their blood glucose level with just insulin. Your health care professional may recommend other medicines to take with insulin to help manage your blood glucose level.\nDiabetes devices and technology\nDiabetes devices and technology can help people with type 1 diabetes take insulin and check their blood glucose level.\nInsulin pump\nAn insulin pump is a small, portable machine that gives you frequent, small doses of insulin using a plastic tube under the skin. The pump is refilled with insulin every 2 to 3 days. Insulin pumps can be programmed to deliver insulin directly into your body 24 hours a day or at certain times.\nBlood glucose meter\nPeople with diabetes can check their blood glucose level with a blood glucose meter. After drawing a small amount of blood from your finger, you can use the meter to measure how much glucose is in your blood at that moment.\nContinuous glucose monitor\nA continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is a device that automatically tracks your blood glucose level throughout the day and night. Researchers have found that using a CGM at home may help you manage your blood glucose level and reduce your risk of developing health problems from diabetes.\nCGMs use sensors placed under your skin that estimate your blood glucose level. You can see information about your blood glucose level at any time in a software program stored on a smartphone, on an insulin pump, or on a separate device called a receiver. These results may help you and your health care team make changes to your meal plan, physical activity level, or diabetes medicines. Many CGM systems have alarms and warnings that let you know if your blood glucose level is too low or too high. For safety, it\u2019s important to act quickly if a CGM alarm sounds.\nArtificial pancreas\nAn artificial pancreas is a system that mimics how a healthy pancreas controls blood glucose levels in the body. The system is made up of three parts. A CGM automatically estimates your blood glucose level and sends the information, without using wires, to a software program on your smartphone or on an insulin pump. The software program calculates how much insulin your body needs, and the insulin pump automatically delivers that amount of insulin to your body.\nResearchers have found that artificial pancreas systems may control blood glucose levels better than other methods in adults and children as young as age 2 years. This is especially true at night, when managing blood glucose levels can be hard for many people with type 1 diabetes.\nAsk your health care professional which diabetes devices will work for you.\nPancreatic islet and pancreas transplant\nPancreatic islet transplant\nA pancreatic islet transplant is used to treat type 1 diabetes in people who struggle to manage their blood glucose levels. Pancreatic islets are clusters of cells in the pancreas that make insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the body\u2019s immune system attacks these cells. A pancreatic islet transplant replaces destroyed islets with new islets from a deceased donor. The new islets make and release insulin. After a pancreatic islet transplant, you\u2019ll take immunosuppressants to prevent the immune system from attacking and destroying the new islets.\nPancreas transplant\nHealth care professionals may consider a pancreas transplant for people with type 1 diabetes who need a kidney transplant or who haven\u2019t been able to manage their blood glucose levels in any other way. A pancreas transplant may restore normal blood glucose levels and prevent other diabetes-related health problems. After a pancreas transplant, you\u2019ll take immunosuppressants to prevent the immune system from attacking and destroying the new pancreas.\nCan I delay or prevent type 1 diabetes in me or in my family members who may be at risk?\nTeplizumab is a medicine that can delay type 1 diabetes symptoms from developing and delay the need for insulin injections. If you or a family member has two or more autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes and increasing blood glucose levels, your health care professional may recommend this medicine.\nThrough studies such as those conducted by TrialNet, researchers are working to identify more risk factors for type 1 diabetes and find new ways to delay and prevent the disease.\nClinical Trials for Type 1 Diabetes\nNIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including type 1 diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for type 1 diabetes?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of clinical studies\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of type 1 diabetes, such as\n- improving the safety and success of pancreatic islet transplantation\n- reducing the immune system response that destroys cells that produce insulin\n- looking at insulin resistance in adolescents with type 1 diabetes\nFind out if clinical trials are right for you.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical trials for type 1 diabetes are looking for participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on type 1 diabetes that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at ClinicalTrials.gov. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study.\nWhat have we learned about type 1 diabetes from NIDDK-funded research?\nResearch funded by NIDDK has improved the quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes by finding better ways to diagnose and treat the disease.\nDelaying the onset of type 1 diabetes\nNIDDK funded research on delaying the onset of type 1 diabetes, including the clinical trials network TrialNet. This research was instrumental in developing the first medicine to delay symptoms of type 1 diabetes, teplizumab.\nPreventing health problems related to type 1 diabetes\nNIDDK funded the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The study showed that participants with type 1 diabetes who kept their blood glucose levels close to normal greatly lowered their chances of developing eye, kidney, and nerve disease.\nA follow-up study, the ongoing Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, has continued to follow DCCT participants since 1994. Findings from the DCCT and EDIC studies changed the way diabetes is treated worldwide, and they show that managing blood glucose levels can help people with diabetes lead longer and healthier lives.\nArtificial pancreas\nNIDDK continues to fund research into new technologies for managing blood glucose levels. A trial funded by NIDDK found that one artificial pancreas technology, a device known as the bionic pancreas, improved type 1 diabetes management compared with standard insulin delivery methods. The Pediatric Artificial Pancreas (PEDAP) Trial found that artificial pancreas technology improved blood glucose level control in young children between ages 2 and 5 years with type 1 diabetes when compared with standard care methods.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes mainly from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. In type 2 diabetes, your body doesn\u2019t make enough insulin or doesn\u2019t use insulin well. Too much glucose then stays in your blood, and not enough reaches your cells.\nThe good news is that you can take steps to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes.\nWho is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes?\nYou can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, type 2 diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are age 45 or older, have a family history of diabetes, or are overweight or have obesity. Diabetes is more common in people who are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, or Pacific Islander.\nPhysical inactivity and certain health problems such as high blood pressure affect your chances of developing type 2 diabetes. You are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you have prediabetes or had gestational diabetes when you were pregnant. Learn more about risk factors for type 2 diabetes.\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes?\nSymptoms of diabetes include\n- increased thirst and urination\n- increased hunger\n- feeling tired\n- blurred vision\n- numbness or tingling in the feet or hands\n- sores that do not heal\n- unexplained weight loss\nSymptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly\u2014over the course of several years\u2014and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or heart disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including\n- overweight and obesity\n- not being physically active\n- insulin resistance\n- genes\nLearn more about the causes of type 2 diabetes.\nHow do health care professionals diagnose type 2 diabetes?\nYour health care professional can diagnose type 2 diabetes based on blood tests. Learn more about blood tests for diabetes and what the results mean.\nHow can I manage my type 2 diabetes?\nManaging your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and quitting smoking if you smoke, are important ways to manage your type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle changes that include planning healthy meals, limiting calories if you are overweight, and being physically active are also part of managing your diabetes. So is taking any prescribed medicines. Work with your health care team to create a diabetes care plan that works for you.\nWhat medicines do I need to treat my type 2 diabetes?\nAlong with following your diabetes care plan, you may need diabetes medicines, which may include pills or medicines you inject under your skin, such as insulin. Over time, you may need more than one diabetes medicine to manage your blood glucose. Even if you don\u2019t take insulin, you may need it at special times, such as during pregnancy or if you are in the hospital. You also may need medicines for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or other conditions.\nLearn more about medicines, insulin, and other diabetes treatments.\nWhat health problems can people with diabetes develop?\nFollowing a good diabetes care plan can help protect against many diabetes-related health problems. However, if not managed, diabetes can lead to problems such as\n- heart disease and stroke\n- nerve damage\n- kidney disease\n- foot problems\n- eye disease\n- gum disease and other dental problems\n- sexual and bladder problems\nMany people with type 2 diabetes also have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Losing weight if you are overweight or have obesity can improve NAFLD. Diabetes is also linked to other health problems such as sleep apnea, depression, some types of cancer, and dementia.\nYou can take steps to lower your chances of developing these diabetes-related health problems.\nHow can I lower my chances of developing type 2 diabetes?\nResearch such as the Diabetes Prevention Program, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, has shown that you can take steps to reduce your chances of developing type 2 diabetes if you have risk factors for the disease. Here are some things you can do to lower your risk:\n- Lose weight if you are overweight, and keep it off. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 7 percent of your current weight.1 For instance, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose about 10 to 14 pounds.\n- Move more. Get at least 30 minutes of physical activity, such as walking, at least 5 days a week. If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional about which activities are best. Start slowly and build up to your goal.\n- Eat healthy foods. Eat smaller portions to reduce the amount of calories you eat each day and help you lose weight. Choosing foods with less fat is another way to reduce calories. Drink water instead of sweetened beverages.\nAsk your health care team what other changes you can make to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.\nMost often, your best chance for preventing type 2 diabetes is to make lifestyle changes that work for you long term.

Although you can\u2019t change risk factors related to family history, age, race, or ethnicity, you may be able to avoid some risk factors by maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active.1\nRead about risk factors for type 2 diabetes below, and see which ones apply to you. Acting on the factors you can change may help delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.\nWhat are the risk factors for type 2 diabetes?\nYou can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you1\n- are overweight or have obesity.\n- are age 35 or older. Children and teens can also develop type 2 diabetes, but the risk increases as a person gets older.\n- have a family history of diabetes.\n- are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander.\n- are not physically active, because of physical limitations, a sedentary lifestyle, or a job that requires sitting for long periods of time.\n- have prediabetes.\n- have a history of gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.\nChildren and teens are also at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if, in addition to the previous risk factors, they were born with a low birth weight or if their parent had gestational diabetes while pregnant with the child.1\nYou are encouraged to talk with a doctor about any of the health conditions listed above that may require medical treatment. Managing health problems may help reduce your chances of developing type 2 diabetes.2 Also, ask your doctor about any medicines you or your child take that might increase your risk. You can also take the Diabetes Risk Test to learn more about your risk for type 2 diabetes.\nDoes your weight put you at risk for type 2 diabetes?\nIf you have overweight or obesity, you may be able to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight and being more physically active.1\nTo see if your weight may put you at risk for type 2 diabetes, learn your body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.\nBody mass index\nYour BMI can help you tell if you are at a healthy weight or have overweight or obesity.\nMost adults with a BMI of 25 or higher are overweight and have a higher risk of developing\ntype 2 diabetes.2 Asian Americans are overweight if their BMI is 23 or higher,1 while Pacific Islanders are overweight if their BMI is 26 or higher.3,4,5\nIf you are age 20 or older, use the BMI calculator for adults to learn your body mass index.\nYou can use a different BMI calculator for children or teens ages 2\u201319 years. This calculator uses BMI, sex, and age to estimate if a child or teen has overweight or obesity.\nWaist circumference\nAnother way to estimate your risk of developing diabetes is to measure your waist circumference. Men have a higher risk of developing diabetes if their waist circumference is more than 40 inches, while women who are not pregnant have a higher risk if their waist circumference is more than 35 inches.6,7\nWaist circumference is an indirect measurement of the amount of fat in your abdomen. Having a large waist circumference is a risk factor for diabetes and heart disease, even if you have a normal BMI.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

You might be overweight or have a parent, brother, or sister with type 2 diabetes. Maybe you had gestational diabetes, which is diabetes that develops during pregnancy. These are just a few examples of factors that can raise your chances of developing type 2 diabetes.\nDiabetes can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and eye and foot problems. Prediabetes also can cause health problems. The good news is that type 2 diabetes can be delayed or even prevented. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to develop health problems, so delaying diabetes by even a few years will benefit your health. You can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing a modest amount of weight by following a reduced-calorie eating plan and being physically active most days of the week. Ask your doctor if you should take the diabetes drug metformin to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.1\nHow can I lower my chances of developing type 2 diabetes?\nResearch such as the Diabetes Prevention Program shows that you can do a lot to reduce your chances of developing type 2 diabetes. Here are some things you can change to lower your risk:\n- Lose weight and keep it off. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 7 percent of your starting weight.1 For instance, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose about 10 to 14 pounds.\n- Move more.

Get started with Your Game Plan to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes.\nWhat should I do if my health care professional told me I have prediabetes?\nPrediabetes is when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes is serious because it raises your chance of developing type 2 diabetes. Many of the same factors that raise your chance of developing type 2 diabetes put you at risk for prediabetes.\nOther names for prediabetes include impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Some people call prediabetes \u201cborderline diabetes.\u201d\nAbout 1 in 3 Americans has prediabetes, according to recent diabetes statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You won\u2019t know if you have prediabetes unless you are tested.\nIf you have prediabetes, you can lower your chance of developing type 2 diabetes. Lose weight if you need to, become more physically active, and follow a reduced-calorie eating plan.\nGet started with Your Game Plan to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes. For more support, you can find a lifestyle change program near you through the National Diabetes Prevention Program.\nIf I had gestational diabetes when I was pregnant, how can I lower my chances of developing type 2 diabetes?\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Most of the time, gestational diabetes goes away after your baby is born. Even if your gestational diabetes goes away, you still have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes within 5 to 10 years. Your child may also be more likely to become obese and develop type 2 diabetes later in life. Making healthy choices helps the whole family and may protect your child from becoming obese or developing diabetes.\nHere are steps you should take for yourself and your child if you had gestational diabetes:\n- Get tested for diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after your baby is born. If your blood glucose is still high, you may have type 2 diabetes. If your blood glucose is normal, you should get tested every 3 years to see if you have developed type 2 diabetes.\n- Be more active and make healthy food choices to get back to a healthy weight.\n- Breastfeed your baby. Breastfeeding gives your baby the right balance of nutrients and helps you burn calories.\n- Ask your doctor if you should take the diabetes drug metformin to help prevent type 2 diabetes.1\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Gestational diabetes can cause health problems in both mother and baby. Managing your diabetes can help protect you and your baby.\nSymptoms & Causes\nGestational diabetes often has no symptoms, or they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate more often. Gestational diabetes is sometimes related to the hormonal changes of pregnancy that make your body less able to use insulin. Genes and extra weight may also play a role.\nTests & Diagnosis\nYour doctor will test you for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. Tests include the glucose challenge test and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If the results of the glucose challenge test show high blood glucose, you will return for an OGTT test to confirm the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.\nManagement & Treatment\nManaging gestational diabetes includes following a healthy eating plan and being physically active. If your eating plan and physical activity aren\u2019t enough to keep your blood glucose in your target range, you may need insulin.\nPrevention\nYou can lower your chance of getting gestational diabetes by losing extra weight before you get pregnant if you are overweight. Being physically active before and during pregnancy also may help prevent gestational diabetes.\nAfter Your Baby is Born\nIf you had gestational diabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Your child is more likely to have obesity or develop type 2 diabetes.

Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin resistance can lead to increased blood glucose levels, also called blood sugar levels, and weight gain. People have prediabetes if they have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes.\nIf your blood glucose levels keep going up, you could develop type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes can affect almost every part of your body, including your heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.\nThe good news is that many people can take steps to prevent or delay prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, working with your health care team to manage your prediabetes or type 2 diabetes may help you prevent other health problems.\nHow common is prediabetes?\nIn 2021, about 97.6 million people in the United States ages 18 and older had prediabetes.1 The number of adults in the United States with prediabetes, in different age groups, hasn\u2019t changed in the last 15 years.1\nPeople with prediabetes may be more at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. But not everyone with prediabetes develops type 2 diabetes. You can take steps to lower your risk.\nWho is more likely to develop insulin resistance or prediabetes?\nCertain factors can increase your chances of developing insulin resistance or prediabetes, including2\n- having overweight, obesity, or a large waist size.\n- being age 35 or older. Children and teens can also develop insulin resistance and prediabetes, but the risk goes up as a person gets older.\n- having a family history of diabetes.\n- being African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, Latino, or Pacific Islander.\n- not being physically active.\n- smoking, including tobacco products and e-cigarettes, or being exposed to secondhand smoke.\n- having a history of gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, or having given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.\n- having other diseases or conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), Cushing\u2019s syndrome, acromegaly, sleep apnea, or viral diseases like COVID-19.\n- taking certain medicines over time, such as glucocorticoids, some antipsychotics, and some medicines for HIV.\nYou can\u2019t change some of these risk factors, such as your age, your family history, or your race. However, you may be able to change some risk factors by reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and stopping smoking.\nWhat health problems can people with insulin resistance and prediabetes develop?\nSome people with prediabetes may have changes in their blood vessels. Changes in your blood vessels can lead to some of the same health problems caused by type 2 diabetes. People with insulin resistance and prediabetes can also develop other health problems, including\n- high blood pressure\n- metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions\u2014including high blood pressure and a large waist size\u2014that increase your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke\n- nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD (also referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD)\n- obesity or a large waist size\n- type 2 diabetes\n- unhealthy levels of cholesterol and triglycerides\nWhat are the symptoms of insulin resistance and prediabetes?\nPeople with insulin resistance and prediabetes usually have no symptoms. Some people with prediabetes may have symptoms that are similar to symptoms of diabetes.\nWhat causes insulin resistance and prediabetes?\nInsulin resistance means that cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don\u2019t respond well to insulin. If your cells don\u2019t respond well to insulin, over time your pancreas may not make enough insulin to help extra glucose enter your cells. When extra glucose can\u2019t enter your cells, you may have higher levels of glucose in your blood. When your blood glucose levels get higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes, you have prediabetes.\nResearchers don\u2019t fully understand what causes insulin resistance and prediabetes. However, people with risk factors for type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop these conditions.\nHow do health care professionals diagnose insulin resistance and prediabetes?\nHealth care professionals may not test for insulin resistance. The test for insulin resistance is primarily used only for research studies.\nTo diagnose prediabetes, your primary health care professional may ask about your medical history and suggest blood tests. Your primary health care professional may be a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner.\nYour health care professional may order tests for prediabetes if you\u2019re age 35 or older, or if you have overweight or obesity and other risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\nHealth care professionals begin to test children who have overweight or obesity when they\u2019re age 10 or have reached puberty.\nIf you have risk factors for type 2 diabetes but tests show you don\u2019t have prediabetes, you may be retested at least every 3 years. If tests show you have prediabetes, you should be tested for type 2 diabetes every year.2\nPeople with prediabetes have a high chance of developing type 2 diabetes within 5 to 10 years.3 You can take steps to prevent or reverse your prediabetes and prevent type 2 diabetes.\nBlood tests\nHealth care professionals can diagnose prediabetes using blood tests that measure your blood glucose level to see if it is higher than normal. Health care professionals may use2\n- the A1C test. You have prediabetes if your A1C results are between 5.7% to 6.4%.\n- the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test. You have prediabetes if your FPG results are between 100 to 125 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter).\nThe FPG test shows your blood glucose level at the time of the test. The A1C test shows your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. In people with certain health conditions, the A1C test may miss prediabetes.\nSometimes health care professionals use an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to diagnose prediabetes. However, the OGTT isn\u2019t as easy to give, takes more time, and costs more than the other tests. You have prediabetes if your OGTT results are between 140 to 199 mg/dL.2\nThe levels of fat in your blood may also go up when you have insulin resistance or prediabetes. Health care professionals may recommend tests for cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\nHow can I prevent or reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes?\nTo prevent or reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes, aim to live a healthy lifestyle and manage your weight. Your health care professional may also prescribe medicines to help you manage your blood glucose levels, lose weight, and prevent type 2 diabetes.\nHealthy living\nHealthy living may help prevent or reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes. Healthy living may also help prevent or delay the health problems related to these conditions. A healthy lifestyle may include\n- consuming healthy foods and drinks\n- being physically active\n- managing your weight\n- getting enough sleep\nMaking these changes can be hard. You may want to start with small changes. You can also ask for help from family, friends, and health care professionals.\nPlanning and tracking your progress can also help you make lifestyle changes. You may be able to take part in a lifestyle change program as part of the National Diabetes Prevention Program.\nManaging your weight\nIf you have insulin resistance or prediabetes, managing your weight can have several health benefits. Ask your health care professional or health care team if you\u2019re at a healthy weight.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded research study, Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), showed that for people at high risk of developing diabetes, losing 5% to 7% of their starting weight helped reduce their chance of developing the disease.4,5\nIf you have overweight or obesity, work with your health care team to create a plan to reach and maintain a healthy weight. Use the calculator below to find out how much 5% to 7% of your weight is and whether weight loss may help lower your diabetes risk.\nMost often, health care professionals recommend lifestyle changes that may help you lose excess weight safely and keep it off. In some cases, weight-loss medicines or weight-loss surgery, also called metabolic and bariatric surgery, can be helpful.\nIf you\u2019re worried about your child\u2019s weight and they have insulin resistance or prediabetes, talk with their health care professional before your child starts a new weight-loss plan.\nMedicines for insulin resistance and prediabetes\nAlong with healthy living and managing weight, health care professionals may also prescribe medicines such as metformin to help you manage your blood glucose levels and to prevent type 2 diabetes.\nThe DPP study showed that metformin could also delay type 2 diabetes. Metformin worked best for women with a history of gestational diabetes, younger adults, and people with obesity. Ask your health care professional if metformin might be right for you.\nIf you have health problems related to insulin resistance and prediabetes, your health care professional may prescribe other medicines, such as medicines to lower blood pressure or triglyceride levels.\nClinical Trials for Insulin Resistance and Prediabetes\nNIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for insulin resistance and prediabetes?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of clinical studies\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of insulin resistance and prediabetes, such as\n- how diet and exercise affect insulin resistance in older adults\n- how some fats can produce insulin resistance in the muscles\n- how medicines, such as metformin, affect people with prediabetes and heart and blood vessel problems\nFind out if clinical studies are right for you.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for insulin resistance and prediabetes are looking for participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on insulin resistance and prediabetes that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at ClinicalTrials.gov. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study.\nWhat have we learned about insulin resistance and prediabetes from NIDDK-funded research?\nNIDDK has supported many research projects to learn more about insulin resistance and prediabetes.\nThe Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) are major studies that changed the way people approach type 2 diabetes prevention worldwide.\n- The DPP study showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can prevent or delay the disease with lifestyle changes that include weight loss through dietary changes and increased physical activity. The study also found that taking metformin, a safe and effective generic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes, also prevents the disease, although to a lesser degree.\n- The DPPOS continues to follow DPP participants to see if lifestyle changes or taking metformin continue to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes over time. To date, the DPPOS has shown that people can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes for at least 15 years with lifestyle changes or metformin.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Researchers have found variants in more than 20 genes that cause monogenic diabetes.1 Monogenic forms of diabetes are part of the group of atypical diabetes. People with atypical forms of diabetes have symptoms and signs that are different than those of type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\nIf you have monogenic diabetes, you may have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Diabetes may raise your risk of eye, kidney, nerve, and heart damage. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes health problems by managing your blood glucose level.\nMaturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) are the two main forms of monogenic diabetes.\nWhat is maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)?\nMODY forms of diabetes usually develop in teens or young adults. People with some forms of MODY have blood glucose levels that are only a little higher than normal and do not change much during their lives. The levels of blood glucose are typically not high enough to damage their organs, so they may not need treatment. However, people with other forms of MODY have higher blood glucose levels and need treatment.\nWhat is neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM)?\nNDM forms of diabetes develop in the first 6 to 12 months of life.2,3 Babies with forms of NDM do not produce enough insulin, which allows their blood glucose levels to go up more than normal. Babies who develop diabetes in the first 6 months of life almost always have a form of NDM.2\nIn most forms of NDM, babies will have lifelong diabetes. These forms of NDM are called permanent NDM. Babies with some forms of NDM have diabetes as infants, but their diabetes goes away during childhood. For these babies, diabetes often shows up again later in life. These forms of NDM are called transient NDM.\nHow common is monogenic diabetes?\nSome research, mainly from the United States and Europe, has found that\n- about 1 to 5 of every 100 people with diabetes have monogenic diabetes4,5\n- NDM is a rare disease, and only 1 in every 90,000 babies has the disease4\nPeople with monogenic diabetes may be misdiagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes because the symptoms may be similar. Therefore, it is difficult to know how many people have monogenic diabetes.\nWho is more likely to have monogenic diabetes?\nPeople with MODY forms of diabetes usually have other family members with diabetes. MODY forms of diabetes most often occur in people ages 30 or younger.6 Forms of NDM most often occur in babies ages 6 months or younger.1,2 More studies are needed to understand which populations, based on race, are more affected by forms of MODY and NDM.\nWhat health problems can people with monogenic diabetes develop?\nSome people with forms of monogenic diabetes may develop the same diabetes health problems as people with other types of diabetes. High blood glucose levels from diabetes can damage every part of your body, including your\n- heart\n- kidneys\n- nerves\n- eyes\n- feet\n- teeth\nIf you have a form of monogenic diabetes, work with your primary health care professional, who may be a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner, to manage your diabetes. Your health care team can help you lower your chances of developing other health problems.\nWhat are the symptoms of monogenic diabetes?\nThe symptoms of monogenic diabetes depend on which gene variant you have. Some people have no symptoms. Other people may have general symptoms of diabetes that include\n- increased urination\n- feeling thirsty\n- feeling very hungry, even after you have eaten\n- blurred vision\n- fatigue\n- numbness or tingling in the feet or hands\n- sores that do not heal\nWhat causes monogenic diabetes?\nA variant, or change, in a single gene causes monogenic diabetes.\nYou inherited genes\u2014which determine things like your hair color, eye color, and height\u2014from each of your parents. In most cases of MODY forms of diabetes, you inherit a gene from one or both parents that causes the disease.\nBabies with NDM forms of diabetes rarely have a family history of the disease. Most cases of NDM are caused by a gene change that happens while a baby develops in the womb.\nMost people with MODY forms of diabetes have inherited a gene for the disease from a parent who also had the disease. Diseases caused by a gene from one parent are called autosomal dominant. If you have a form of NDM or MODY that is autosomal dominant, your child has a 50% chance of having the disease.\nSome forms of NDM or MODY occur only if a child inherits a gene for the disease from both parents. In most cases, neither of the child\u2019s parents had the disease. Diseases that occur only if you inherit a gene from both parents who don\u2019t have the disease are called autosomal recessive. If you inherit a gene for a recessive form of NDM or MODY from only one parent, you won\u2019t have the disease. However, you can pass that gene to future generations.\nDifferent gene variants cause monogenic diabetes in different ways. For example, gene variants may\n- affect how the pancreas develops\n- cause the pancreas to produce insulin that does not work well\n- destroy cells in the pancreas that produce insulin\nHow do health care professionals diagnose monogenic diabetes?\nYour health care professional will usually test you for forms of monogenic diabetes if you have diabetes, are younger than 30 years old, don\u2019t have overweight or obesity, and have family members with these forms of diabetes.\nHealth care professionals will diagnose diabetes using your symptoms, medical and family history, and diabetes tests. Your health care professional may also order tests to find out if your diabetes is type 1, type 2, or monogenic. The type of diabetes you have will help your health care professional determine how to treat the disease.\nBlood glucose tests\nHealth care professionals can diagnose diabetes using blood tests that measure your glucose level to see if it is higher than normal. People with some forms of monogenic diabetes have blood glucose levels that are a little higher than normal.2\nBlood glucose tests can help your health care professional tell if you have diabetes. However, these tests do not show the type of diabetes you have.\nAutoantibodies\nYour health care professional will order a test for autoantibodies to find out if you have type 1 diabetes. Autoantibodies are proteins made by your immune system that attack your healthy tissues and cells by mistake. In rare cases, people with monogenic diabetes may also have autoantibodies in their blood.\nGenetic testing\nGenetic testing looks for gene variants. Health care professionals use genetic tests to diagnose monogenic diabetes.\nHealth care professionals may request a genetic test for2\n- babies ages 6 months or younger who develop diabetes\n- babies who develop diabetes between ages 6 months and 1 year and have some other medical problems\n- people who have diabetes at a young age, do not have overweight or obesity, and have a strong family history of diabetes\nWhat do I need to know about genetic counseling?\nIf you, your partner, or family members have monogenic diabetes, you may want to consider genetic counseling. Genetic counseling can help you decide if you should get tested for monogenic diabetes. Genetic counseling can also help you understand the risk of your children developing this disease. Talk with your health care professional for more information about how genetic counseling could help you, what it may cost, and whether it\u2019s covered by your insurance.\nHow can I manage monogenic diabetes?\nHow you manage monogenic diabetes will depend on the specific gene variant you have. Your health care professional and diabetes care team will work with you to develop a plan to manage your diabetes. Your health care professional may refer you to, or work with, a medical center that focuses on monogenic diabetes to help manage the disease.\nMedicines\nSome people with monogenic diabetes may need diabetes medicines. These medicines may include\n- sulfonylureas, oral diabetes medicines that help your body make more insulin. These medicines can treat certain forms of MODY and NDM.\n- insulin. Some people with monogenic diabetes need to take insulin all their lives. Others may need to take insulin early in life and may be able to switch to sulfonylureas later in life.\n- other medicines. Some medicines, called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, work in your kidneys to get rid of glucose. Other medicines, called glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists, increase insulin production and decrease your appetite.\nCan I prevent monogenic diabetes?\nAt this time, monogenic diabetes can\u2019t be prevented. However, researchers are working to find possible risk factors and ways to prevent the disease.\nClinical Trials for Monogenic Diabetes\nNIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for monogenic diabetes?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of clinical studies\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying different aspects of monogenic diabetes, such as ways to improve diagnosis.\nFind out if clinical studies are right for you.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for monogenic diabetes are looking for participants?\nYou can find clinical studies on monogenic diabetes at ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition to searching for federally funded studies, you can expand or narrow your search to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study.\nWhat have we learned about monogenic diabetes from NIDDK-funded research?\nNIDDK has supported many research projects to learn more about monogenic diabetes\n- Progress in Diabetes Genetics in Youth (ProDiGY). This study evaluated how common MODY was among multiethnic youth who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The study found that 2.8% of the participants had MODY.7\n- a study with 160 participants showed that people with monogenic diabetes can also have obesity or overweight. They can also have antibodies that are seen in type 1 diabetes.\n- Monogenic Diabetes Registry. This database was created in 2008 to collect data related to diagnosis, treatment, and natural history of people with monogenic diabetes.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

The medical abbreviation of cystic fibrosis is CF.Normal mucus is slippery and protects the airways, digestive tract, and other organs and tissues. Cystic fibrosis causes mucus to become thick and sticky. As mucus builds up, it can cause blockages, damage, or infections in affected organs.\nCystic fibrosis used to cause death in childhood. Survival has improved because of advances in newborn screening, medicines, nutrition, and lung transplants. Nearly 40,000 children and adults in the United States \u2014 and more than 100,000 worldwide \u2014 are now living with cystic fibrosis. Children born between 2019 and 2023 who have cystic fibrosis are expected to live an average of 61 years. On average, half of babies born in 2023 with cystic fibrosis are expected to reach the age of 68 or older.\nSome people who have cystic fibrosis have few or no symptoms, while others experience severe symptoms or life-threatening complications. The most serious and common complications of cystic fibrosis are problems with the lungs, typically caused by serious lung infections.

High blood glucose can cause other health problems over time, such as heart disease, nerve damage, eye problems, and kidney disease. The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational.\nEstimated prevalence of diabetes in the United States\n- Total: 38.4 million people of all ages had diabetes (11.6% of the population) in 2021. 38.1 million were adults ages 18 years or older.\n- Diagnosed: 29.7 million people of all ages had been diagnosed with diabetes (8.9% of the population).\n- 29.4 million were adults ages 18 years or older.\n- 352,000 were children and adolescents younger than age 20, including 304,000 with type 1 diabetes.\n- Age-adjusted data from 2019 to 2021 showed that, for both men and women ages 18 years or older, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was highest among American Indian and Alaska Native adults (13.6%), followed by non-Hispanic Black adults (12.1%), adults of Hispanic origin (11.7%), non-Hispanic Asian adults (9.1%), and non-Hispanic White adults (6.9%).\n- Undiagnosed: 8.7 million adults ages 18 years or older had diabetes but were undiagnosed (22.8% of adults with diabetes were undiagnosed).\nRead about the estimates of diabetes in the United States and the prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in the National Diabetes Statistics Report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nAccording to the American Diabetes Association\u2019s Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S., the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2022 was $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in reduced productivity.\nPrediabetes Facts and Statistics\nPrediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. Prediabetes usually occurs when a person\u2019s body cannot effectively use the insulin it makes or when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to keep the body\u2019s blood glucose levels in the normal range. People with prediabetes have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nEstimated prevalence of prediabetes in the United States\n- Among U.S. adults ages 18 years or older, 97.6 million\u2014more than 1 in 3\u2014had prediabetes in 2021.\n- 32.8 million adults ages 18 to 44 years old\n- 37.5 million adults ages 45 to 64 years old\n- 27.2 million adults ages 65 or older\n- A higher percentage of men (41%) than women (32%) had prediabetes in 2017\u20132020, when data were adjusted by age.\n- The prevalence of prediabetes in adults was similar across racial and ethnic groups and education levels in 2017\u20132020, when data were adjusted by age.\n- Among adolescents ages 12 to 18 years old, about 1 of 5 (18% of adolescents) had prediabetes in 2005\u20132016.1\nRead about the prevalence of prediabetes among adults in the National Diabetes Statistics Report from CDC.\nGestational Diabetes Facts and Statistics\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that pregnant women may develop if they don\u2019t already have diabetes. High blood glucose levels during pregnancy can cause problems for pregnant women and their babies, and can also increase the chance of having a miscarriage.\n- Every year, 2% to 10% of pregnancies in the United States are affected by gestational diabetes.\n- About 50% of women who develop gestational diabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes.2\nAdditional Reports on Diabetes\n- National Diabetes Statistics Report from CDC provides scientific data and statistics on diabetes in the United States.\n- Diabetes in America from NIDDK provides new and updated data on diabetes and its complications in the United States.\n- Diabetes in America, 3rd Edition from NIDDK in 2018 provides comprehensive data on diabetes and its complications in the United States.\n- National Diabetes Survey 2016 from NIDDK presents findings from a 2016 survey that measured trends in diabetes awareness, knowledge, and behavior.\n- Diabetes and Obesity Maps from CDC show the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity and diagnosed diabetes among adults in the United States by county in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019.\n- Diabetes and African Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Minority Health provides prevalence data on diabetes among African Americans, including death rates, risk factors, and links to more information.\n- Diabetes and American Indians/Alaska Natives from the HHS Office of Minority Health provides prevalence data on diabetes among American Indians and Alaska Natives, including death rates, risk factors, and links to more information.\n- Diabetes and Asian Americans from the HHS Office of Minority Health provides prevalence data on diabetes among Asian Americans, including death rates, risk factors, and links to more information.\n- Diabetes and Hispanic Americans from the HHS Office of Minority Health provides prevalence data on diabetes among Hispanic Americans, including death rates, risk factors, and links to more information.\n- World Health Organization provides information on the global burden of diabetes, prevention, management, and capacity for prevention and control, as well as a fact sheet on diabetes.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/heart-disease-stroke": "Diabetes, Heart Disease, & Stroke\nOn this page:\n- What is the link between diabetes, heart disease, and stroke?\n- What else increases my chances of heart disease or stroke if I have diabetes?\n- How can I lower my chances of a heart attack or stroke if I have diabetes?\n- How do doctors diagnose heart disease in people with diabetes?\n- What are the warning signs of heart attack and stroke?\n- Clinical Trials for Diabetes, Heart Disease, & Stroke\nHaving diabetes means you are more likely to develop heart disease. People with diabetes are also more likely to have certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, that increase their chances of having a heart attack or a stroke.\nIf you have diabetes, you can protect your heart and health by managing your blood glucose, also called blood sugar. You can also protect yourself by controlling your high blood pressure and high cholesterol. If you smoke, get help to stop.\nWhat is the link between diabetes, heart disease, and stroke?\nHigh blood glucose from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. Over time, this damage can lead to heart disease.1\nPeople with diabetes tend to develop heart disease at a younger age than people without diabetes. Adults with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as adults without diabetes.2,3\nThe good news is that the steps you take to manage your diabetes also help lower your chances of having heart disease or stroke.\nWhat else increases my chances of heart disease or stroke if I have diabetes?\nYour risk for heart disease is greater if you are male rather than female, whether you have diabetes or not.2 If you do have diabetes, other factors add to your chances of developing heart disease or having a stroke.\nSmoking\nSmoking raises your risk of developing heart disease. If you have diabetes, it is important to stop smoking, because both smoking and diabetes narrow blood vessels. Smoking also increases your chances of developing other long-term problems such as\n- lung disease\n- lower leg infections and ulcers\n- foot or leg amputation\nHigh blood pressure\nIf you have high blood pressure, your heart works harder to pump blood. High blood pressure can strain your heart, damage blood vessels, and increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, and eye or kidney problems. Have your blood pressure checked regularly and work with your doctor to control or lower high blood pressure.\nAbnormal cholesterol levels\nCholesterol is a type of fat, produced by your liver and found in your blood. You have two kinds of cholesterol in your blood: LDL and HDL.\nLDL, often called \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, can build up and clog your blood vessels. High levels of LDL cholesterol raise your risk of developing heart disease. HDL is sometimes called \u201cgood cholesterol.\u201d Higher levels of HDL is linked to lower risk for heart disease and stroke. To improve LDL and HDL levels, limit the amount of fat in your eating plan, eat more plant-based foods, and get regular physical activity.\nAnother type of blood fat, triglycerides, also can raise your risk of heart disease when the levels are higher than recommended by your health care team.\nObesity and belly fat\nBeing overweight or having obesity can make it harder to manage your diabetes and raise your risk for many health problems, including heart disease and high blood pressure. If you are overweight, a healthy eating plan with fewer calories and more physical activity often will lower your blood glucose levels and reduce your need for medicines.\nExcess belly fat around your waist, even if you are not overweight, can raise your chances of developing heart disease.\nYou have excess belly fat if your waist measures\n- more than 40 inches and you are a man\n- more than 35 inches and you are a woman\nChronic kidney disease\nHeart disease is closely linked with chronic kidney disease, a condition in which your kidneys are damaged and can\u2019t filter blood the way they should. Having diabetes is a risk factor for developing kidney disease, which affects about 40% of people with diabetes. Other risk factors for developing kidney disease are high blood pressure and a family history of kidney failure.\nIf you have risk factors, get tested for kidney disease and protect your kidneys by making healthy food choices, being more active, aiming for a healthy weight, and managing health conditions that cause kidney damage.\nFamily history of heart disease\nA family history of heart disease may add to your chances of developing the condition. If one or more of your family members had a heart attack before age 50, you have double the chance of developing heart disease compared with people who have no family history of the disease.4\nYou can\u2019t change whether heart disease runs in your family. But if you have diabetes, it\u2019s even more important to take steps to protect yourself from heart disease and decrease your chances of having a stroke.\nHow can I lower my chances of a heart attack or stroke if I have diabetes?\nTaking care of your diabetes is important to help you protect your heart. You can substantially lower your chances of having a heart attack or stroke by taking the following steps to keep your heart and blood vessels healthy.5\nManage your diabetes ABCs\nKnow your diabetes ABCs to help you manage your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Stop smoking if you have diabetes to lower your chances of developing heart disease.\nA is for the A1C test\nThe A1C test shows your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. This is different from the blood glucose checks you do every day. The higher your A1C number, the higher your blood glucose levels have been during the past 3 months. High levels of blood glucose can harm your heart, blood vessels, kidneys, feet, and eyes.\nThe A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7%. Some people may do better with a slightly higher A1C goal. Your A1C goals may also change as you get older and your lifestyle changes. Ask your health care team what your goal should be.\nB is for blood pressure\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood against the wall of your blood vessels. If your blood pressure gets too high, it makes your heart work too hard. High blood pressure can cause a heart attack or stroke and damage your kidneys and eyes.\nThe blood pressure goal for most people with diabetes is below 140/90 mm Hg. Ask what your goal should be.\nC is for cholesterol\nA buildup of cholesterol, a form of fat found in your blood, can cause a heart attack or stroke. Ask your health care team what your cholesterol numbers should be. If you are over 40 years old, you may need to take medicine, such as a statin, to lower your cholesterol levels and protect your heart. Some people with very high LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol may need to take medicine starting at a younger age.\nLearn about getting your cholesterol checked.\nS is for stop smoking\nQuitting smoking is especially important for people with diabetes because both smoking and diabetes narrow blood vessels, so your heart has to work harder. E-cigarettes aren\u2019t a safe option either.\nIf you quit smoking\n- you will lower your risk for heart attack; stroke; nerve, kidney, and eye disease; and amputation\n- your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels may improve\n- your blood circulation will improve\n- you may have an easier time being physically active\nIf you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help so you don\u2019t have to do it alone. You can start by calling the National Quitline at 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. For tips on quitting, go to Smokefree.gov.\nAsk your health care team about your goals for A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and what you can do to reach these goals. To improve your diabetes self-management skills, you may want a referral to a diabetes educator or a registered dietitian. Medicare, some private insurers, and other organizations will provide financial assistance for some of these services.\nYou can keep track of your ABCs with a diabetes record form. You can use it when you meet with your health care team in person or remotely. Talk with your team about your goals and how you are doing, and whether you need to make any changes to your diabetes care plan.\nDevelop or maintain healthy lifestyle habits\nHealthy lifestyle habits that you stick with can help you manage your diabetes and prevent heart disease.\n- Follow your healthy eating plan.\n- Make physical activity part of your routine.\n- Stay at or get to a healthy weight.\n- Get enough sleep.\nLearn more about these tips to manage diabetes.\nWatch a video about what you can do to keep your heart healthy.\nLearn about the Body Weight Planner, which may help you create a personal plan to reach your goal weight.\nLearn to manage stress\nManaging diabetes is not always easy. Feeling stressed, sad, lonely, or angry is common when you are living with diabetes. You may know what to do to stay healthy but may have trouble sticking with your plan over time. Long-term stress can raise your blood glucose and blood pressure, but you can learn ways to lower your stress. Try deep breathing, gardening, taking a walk, doing yoga, talking with a loved one, working on a hobby, or listening to your favorite music. Learn more about healthy ways to cope with stress.\nTake medicine to protect your heart\nMedicines may be an important part of your treatment plan. Your doctor will prescribe medicine based on your specific needs. Medicine may help you\n- meet your A1C (blood glucose), blood pressure, and cholesterol goals.\n- reduce your risk of blood clots, heart attack, or stroke.\n- treat angina, or chest pain that is often a symptom of heart disease. Angina can also be an early symptom of a heart attack.\n- treat heart failure, which is a form of heart disease in which your heart cannot pump blood well enough for your body to work properly.\nAsk your doctor whether you should take daily aspirin. Aspirin is not safe for everyone. Your doctor can tell you whether taking aspirin is right for you and exactly how much to take.\nStatins can reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke in some people with diabetes. In addition, certain diabetes medicines have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks and death in patients at very high risk of having a heart attack. Talk with your doctor to find out whether taking a statin or a diabetes medicine that reduces heart attack risk is right for you.\nTake medicines the way your doctor or health care team tells you to. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about your medicines. Before you start a new medicine, ask your doctor about possible side effects and how you can avoid them. If the side effects of your medicine bother you, tell your doctor. Don\u2019t stop taking your medicines without checking with your doctor first.\nHow do doctors diagnose heart disease in people with diabetes?\nDoctors diagnose heart disease in people with diabetes based on their\n- symptoms\n- medical and family history\n- how likely they are to have heart disease\n- a physical exam\n- results from tests and procedures\nTests used to monitor your diabetes\u2014A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol\u2014help your doctor decide whether it is important to do additional tests to check your heart health or to refer you to a specialist such as a cardiologist.\nAsk your health care team these questions.\n- What can we do to lower my chances of getting heart disease?\n- How can we work together to help me maintain my goals for A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol?\n- What medicines, such as aspirin or a statin, will help protect my heart?\n- Are there diabetes medicines that will help protect my heart?\nWhat are the warning signs of heart attack and stroke?\nCall 9-1-1 right away if you have any of these warning signs of a heart attack\n- pain or pressure in your chest that lasts longer than a few minutes or goes away and comes back\n- pain or discomfort in one or both of your arms or shoulders, or your back, neck, or jaw\n- shortness of breath\n- sweating or light-headedness\n- indigestion or nausea (feeling sick to your stomach)\n- feeling very tired\nTreatment works best when it is given right away. Warning signs can be different in different people. You may not have all the listed symptoms.\nWomen may experience chest pain, nausea, and vomiting; feel very tired (sometimes for days); and have pain that spreads to the back, neck, throat, arms, shoulders, or jaw. People with diabetes-related nerve damage may not notice any chest pain.\nIf you have angina, it\u2019s important to know how and when to seek medical treatment.\nCall 9-1-1 right away if you have any of these warning signs of a stroke, including sudden\n- weakness or numbness of your face, arm, or leg on one side of your body\n- confusion, or trouble talking or understanding\n- dizziness, loss of balance, or trouble walking\n- trouble seeing out of one or both eyes\n- sudden, severe headache\nIf you have any one of these warning signs, call 9-1-1. You can help prevent permanent damage by getting to a hospital within an hour of a stroke.\nClinical Trials for Diabetes, Heart Disease, & Stroke\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for diabetes, heart disease, and stroke?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of clinical studies\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, such as\n- risk factors for heart disease and stroke in specific populations, such as Black Americans with diabetes\n- improved imaging techniques and tests to help diagnose and treat conditions that lead to heart attacks and stroke\n- the role of genetics in diabetes, heart disease, and stroke\nFind out if clinical studies are right for you.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/diabetic-kidney-disease": "Diabetic Kidney Disease\nIn this section:\n- What is diabetic kidney disease?\n- How does diabetes cause kidney disease?\n- What increases my chances of diabetic kidney disease?\n- How can I tell if I have diabetic kidney disease?\n- How can I keep my kidneys healthy if I have diabetes?\n- How can I cope with the stress of managing my diabetes?\n- Does diabetic kidney disease get worse over time?\nWhat is diabetic kidney disease?\nDiabetic kidney disease is a type of kidney disease caused by diabetes.\nDiabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. About 1 out of 3 adults with diabetes has kidney disease.1\nThe main job of the kidneys is to filter wastes and extra water out of your blood to make urine. Your kidneys also help control blood pressure and make hormones that your body needs to stay healthy.\nWhen your kidneys are damaged, they can\u2019t filter blood like they should, which can cause wastes to build up in your body. Kidney damage can also cause other health problems.\nKidney damage caused by diabetes usually occurs slowly, over many years. You can take steps to protect your kidneys and to prevent or delay kidney damage.\nWatch a video about diabetes and kidney disease.\nWhat are other names for diabetic kidney disease?\nDiabetic kidney disease is also called DKD, chronic kidney disease, CKD, kidney disease of diabetes, or diabetic nephropathy.\nHow does diabetes cause kidney disease?\nHigh blood glucose, also called blood sugar, can damage the blood vessels in your kidneys. When the blood vessels are damaged, they don\u2019t work as well. Many people with diabetes also develop high blood pressure, which can also damage your kidneys. Learn more about high blood pressure and kidney disease.\nWhat increases my chances of developing diabetic kidney disease?\nHaving diabetes for a longer time increases the chances that you will have kidney damage. If you have diabetes, you are more likely to develop kidney disease if your\n- blood glucose is too high\n- blood pressure is too high\nAfrican Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos develop diabetes, kidney disease, and kidney failure at a higher rate than Caucasians.\nYou are also more likely to develop kidney disease if you have diabetes and\n- smoke\n- don\u2019t follow your diabetes eating plan\n- eat foods high in salt\n- are not active\n- are overweight\n- have heart disease\n- have a family history of kidney failure\nHow can I tell if I have diabetic kidney disease?\nMost people with diabetic kidney disease do not have symptoms. The only way to know if you have diabetic kidney disease is to get your kidneys checked.\nHealth care professionals use blood and urine tests to check for diabetic kidney disease. Your health care professional will check your urine for albumin and will also do a blood test to see how well your kidneys are filtering your blood.\nYou should get tested every year for kidney disease if you\n- have type 2 diabetes\n- have had type 1 diabetes for more than 5 years\nHow can I keep my kidneys healthy if I have diabetes?\nThe best way to slow or prevent diabetes-related kidney disease is to try to reach your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. Healthy lifestyle habits and taking your medicines as prescribed can help you achieve these goals and improve your health overall.\nReach your blood glucose goals\nYour health care professional will test your A1C. The A1C is a blood test that shows your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. This is different from the blood glucose checks that you may do yourself. The higher your A1C number, the higher your blood glucose levels have been during the past 3 months.\nThe A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7 percent. Ask your health care team what your goal should be. Reaching your goal numbers will help you protect your kidneys.\nTo reach your A1C goal, your health care professional may ask you to check your blood glucose levels. Work with your health care team to use the results to guide decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines. Ask your health care team how often you should check your blood glucose level.\nControl your blood pressure\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood against the wall of your blood vessels. High blood pressure makes your heart work too hard. It can cause heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.\nYour health care team will also work with you to help you set and reach your blood pressure goal. The blood pressure goal for most people with diabetes is below 140/90 mm Hg. Ask your health care team what your goal should be.\nMedicines that lower blood pressure can also help slow kidney damage. Two types of blood pressure medicines, ACE inhibitors and ARBs, play a special role in protecting your kidneys. Each has been found to slow kidney damage in people with diabetes who have high blood pressure and DKD. The names of these medicines end in \u2013pril or \u2013sartan. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not safe for women who are pregnant.\nDevelop or maintain healthy lifestyle habits\nHealthy lifestyle habits can help you reach your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. Following the steps below will also help you keep your kidneys healthy\n- Stop smoking.\n- Work with a dietitian to develop a diabetes meal plan and limit salt and sodium.\n- Make physical activity part of your routine.\n- Stay at or get to a healthy weight.\n- Get enough sleep. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.\nLearn more about these tips to manage diabetes.\nTake medicines as prescribed\nMedicines may be an important part of your treatment plan. Your health care professional will prescribe medicine based on your specific needs. Medicine can help you meet your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. You may need to take more than one kind of medicine to control your blood pressure.\nHow can I cope with the stress of managing my diabetes?\nManaging diabetes isn\u2019t always easy. Feeling stressed, sad, or angry is common when you are living with diabetes. You may know what to do to stay healthy but may have trouble sticking with your plan over time. Long-term stress can raise your blood glucose and blood pressure, but you can learn ways to lower your stress. Try deep breathing, gardening, taking a walk, doing yoga, meditating, doing a hobby, or listening to your favorite music. Learn more about healthy ways to cope with stress.\nDoes diabetic kidney disease get worse over time?\nKidney damage from diabetes can get worse over time. However, you can take steps to keep your kidneys healthy and help slow kidney damage to prevent or delay kidney failure. Kidney failure means that your kidneys have lost most of their ability to function\u2014less than 15 percent of normal kidney function. However, most people with diabetes and kidney disease don\u2019t end up with kidney failure.\nIf your kidneys become damaged as a result of diabetes, learn how to manage kidney disease.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/foot-problems": "Diabetes & Foot Problems\nIn this section:\n- How can diabetes affect my feet?\n- What can I do to keep my feet healthy?\n- When should I see my health care provider about foot problems?\n- Clinical Trials\nFoot problems are common in people with diabetes. You might be afraid you\u2019ll lose a toe, foot, or leg to diabetes, or know someone who has, but you can lower your chances of having diabetes-related foot problems by taking care of your feet every day. Managing your blood glucose levels, also called blood sugar, can also help keep your feet healthy.\nHow can diabetes affect my feet?\nOver time, diabetes may cause nerve damage, also called diabetic neuropathy, that can cause tingling and pain, and can make you lose feeling in your feet. When you lose feeling in your feet, you may not feel a pebble inside your sock or a blister on your foot, which can lead to cuts and sores. Cuts and sores can become infected.\nDiabetes also can lower the amount of blood flow in your feet. Not having enough blood flowing to your legs and feet can make it hard for a sore or an infection to heal. Sometimes, a bad infection never heals. The infection might lead to gangrene.\nGangrene and foot ulcers that do not get better with treatment can lead to an amputation of your toe, foot, or part of your leg. A surgeon may perform an amputation to prevent a bad infection from spreading to the rest of your body, and to save your life. Good foot care is very important to prevent serious infections and gangrene.\nAlthough rare, nerve damage from diabetes can lead to changes in the shape of your feet, such as Charcot\u2019s foot. Charcot\u2019s foot may start with redness, warmth, and swelling. Later, bones in your feet and toes can shift or break, which can cause your feet to have an odd shape, such as a \u201crocker bottom.\u201d\nWhat can I do to keep my feet healthy?\nWork with your health care team to make a diabetes self-care plan, which is an action plan for how you will manage your diabetes. Your plan should include foot care. A foot doctor, also called a podiatrist, and other specialists may be part of your health care team.\nInclude these steps in your foot care plan:\nCheck your feet every day\nYou may have foot problems, but feel no pain in your feet. Checking your feet each day will help you spot problems early before they get worse. A good way to remember is to check your feet each evening when you take off your shoes. Also check between your toes. If you have trouble bending over to see your feet, try using a mirror to see them, or ask someone else to look at your feet.\nLook for problems such as\n- cuts, sores, or red spots\n- swelling or fluid-filled blisters\n- ingrown toenails, in which the edge of your nail grows into your skin\n- corns or calluses, which are spots of rough skin caused by too much rubbing or pressure on the same spot\n- plantar warts, which are flesh-colored growths on the bottom of the feet\n- athlete\u2019s foot\n- warm spots\nIf you have certain foot problems that make it more likely you will develop a sore on your foot, your doctor may recommend taking the temperature of the skin on different parts of your feet. A \u201chot spot\u201d can be the first sign that a blister or an ulcer is starting.\nCover a blister, cut, or sore with a bandage. Smooth corns and calluses as explained below.\nWash your feet every day\nWash your feet with soap in warm, not hot, water. Test the water to make sure it is not too hot. You can use a thermometer (90\u00b0 to 95\u00b0 F is safe) or your elbow to test the warmth of the water. Do not soak your feet because your skin will get too dry.\nAfter washing and drying your feet, put talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. Skin between the toes tends to stay moist. Powder will keep the skin dry to help prevent an infection.\nSmooth corns and calluses gently\nThick patches of skin called corns or calluses can grow on the feet. If you have corns or calluses, talk with your foot doctor about the best way to care for these foot problems. If you have nerve damage, these patches can become ulcers.\nIf your doctor tells you to, use a pumice stone to smooth corns and calluses after bathing or showering. A pumice stone is a type of rock used to smooth the skin. Rub gently, only in one direction, to avoid tearing the skin.\nDo NOT\n- cut corns and calluses\n- use corn plasters, which are medicated pads\n- use liquid corn and callus removers\nCutting and over-the counter corn removal products can damage your skin and cause an infection.\nTo keep your skin smooth and soft, rub a thin coat of lotion, cream, or petroleum jelly on the tops and bottoms of your feet. Do not put lotion or cream between your toes because moistness might cause an infection.\nTrim your toenails straight across\nTrim your toenails, when needed, after you wash and dry your feet. Using toenail clippers, trim your toenails straight across. Do not cut into the corners of your toenail. Gently smooth each nail with an emery board or nonsharp nail file. Trimming this way helps prevent cutting your skin and keeps the nails from growing into your skin.\nHave a foot doctor trim your toenails if\n- you cannot see, feel, or reach your feet\n- your toenails are thick or yellowed\n- your nails curve and grow into the skin\nIf you want to get a pedicure at a salon, you should bring your own nail tools to prevent getting an infection. You can ask your health care provider what other steps you can take at the salon to prevent infection.\nWear shoes and socks at all times\nWear shoes and socks at all times. Do not walk barefoot or in just socks \u2013 even when you are indoors. You could step on something and hurt your feet. You may not feel any pain and may not know that you hurt yourself.\nCheck the inside of your shoes before putting them on, to make sure the lining is smooth and free of pebbles or other objects.\nMake sure you wear socks, stockings, or nylons with your shoes to keep from getting blisters and sores. Choose clean, lightly padded socks that fit well. Socks with no seams are best.\nWear shoes that fit well and protect your feet. Here are some tips for finding the right type of shoes:\n- Walking shoes and athletic shoes are good for daily wear. They support your feet and allow them to \u201cbreathe.\u201d\n- Do not wear vinyl or plastic shoes, because they do not stretch or \u201cbreathe.\u201d\n- When buying shoes, make sure they feel good and have enough room for your toes. Buy shoes at the end of the day, when your feet are the largest, so that you can find the best fit.\n- If you have a bunion, or hammertoes, which are toes that curl under your feet, you may need extra-wide or deep shoes.1 Do not wear shoes with pointed toes or high heels, because they put too much pressure on your toes.\n- If your feet have changed shape, such as from Charcot\u2019s foot, you may need special shoes or shoe inserts, called orthotics. You also may need inserts if you have bunions, hammertoes, or other foot problems.\nWhen breaking in new shoes, only wear them for a few hours at first and then check your feet for areas of soreness.\nMedicare Part B insurance and other health insurance programs may help pay for these special shoes or inserts. Ask your insurance plan if it covers your special shoes or inserts.\nProtect your feet from hot and cold\nIf you have nerve damage from diabetes, you may burn your feet and not know you did. Take the following steps to protect your feet from heat:\n- Wear shoes at the beach and on hot pavement.\n- Put sunscreen on the tops of your feet to prevent sunburn.\n- Keep your feet away from heaters and open fires.\n- Do not put a hot water bottle or heating pad on your feet.\nWear socks in bed if your feet get cold. In the winter, wear lined, waterproof boots to keep your feet warm and dry.\nKeep the blood flowing to your feet\nTry the following tips to improve blood flow to your feet:\n- Put your feet up when you are sitting.\n- Wiggle your toes for a few minutes throughout the day. Move your ankles up and down and in and out to help blood flow in your feet and legs.\n- Do not wear tight socks or elastic stockings. Do not try to hold up loose socks with rubber bands.\n- Be more physically active. Choose activities that are easy on your feet, such as walking, dancing, yoga or stretching, swimming, or bike riding.\n- Stop smoking.\nSmoking can lower the amount of blood flow to your feet. If you smoke, ask for help to stop. You can get help by calling the national quitline at 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. For tips on quitting, go to SmokeFree.gov.\nGet a foot check at every health care visit\nAsk your health care team to check your feet at each visit. Take off your shoes and socks when you\u2019re in the exam room so they will remember to check your feet. At least once a year, get a thorough foot exam, including a check of the feeling and pulses in your feet.\nGet a thorough foot exam at each health care visit if you have\n- changes in the shape of your feet\n- loss of feeling in your feet\n- peripheral artery disease\n- had foot ulcers or an amputation in the past1\nAsk your health care team to show you how to care for your feet.\nWhen should I see my health care provider about foot problems?\nCall your health care provider right away if you have\n- a cut, blister, or bruise on your foot that does not start to heal after a few days\n- skin on your foot that becomes red, warm, or painful\u2014signs of a possible infection\n- a callus with dried blood inside of it,which often can be the first sign of a wound under the callus\n- a foot infection that becomes black and smelly\u2014signs you might have gangrene\nAsk your provider to refer you to a foot doctor, or podiatrist, if needed.\nClinical Trials\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.\nWhat are clinical trials, and are they right for you?\nClinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. Researchers also use clinical trials to look at other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses. Find out if clinical trials are right for you.\nWhat clinical trials are open?\nClinical trials that are currently open and are recruiting can be viewed at ClinicalTrials.gov.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/diabetic-eye-disease": "Diabetic Eye Disease\nOn this page:\n- What is diabetic eye disease?\n- How does diabetes affect my eyes?\n- How common is diabetic eye disease?\n- Who is more likely to develop diabetic eye disease?\n- What are the symptoms of diabetic eye disease?\n- When should I see a doctor right away?\n- How do doctors diagnose eye problems from diabetes?\n- How do doctors treat diabetic eye disease?\n- What can I do to protect my eyes?\n- What if I already have some vision loss from diabetes?\nWhat is diabetic eye disease?\nDiabetic eye disease is a group of eye problems that can affect people with diabetes. These conditions include diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataracts, and glaucoma.\nOver time, diabetes can cause damage to your eyes that can lead to poor vision or even blindness. But you can take steps to prevent diabetic eye disease, or keep it from getting worse, by taking care of your diabetes.\nThe best ways to manage your diabetes and keep your eyes healthy are to\n- manage your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol, sometimes called the diabetes ABCs\n- If you smoke, get help to quit smoking\n- have a dilated eye exam once a year\nOften, there are no warning signs of diabetic eye disease or vision loss when damage first develops. A full, dilated eye exam helps your doctor find and treat eye problems early\u2014often before much vision loss can occur.\nHow does diabetes affect my eyes?\nDiabetes affects your eyes when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.\nIn the short term, you are not likely to have vision loss from high blood glucose. People sometimes have blurry vision for a few days or weeks when they\u2019re changing their diabetes care plan or medicines. High glucose can change fluid levels or cause swelling in the tissues of your eyes that help you to focus, causing blurred vision. This type of blurry vision is temporary and goes away when your glucose level gets closer to normal.\nIf your blood glucose stays high over time, it can damage the tiny blood vessels in the back of your eyes. This damage can begin during prediabetes, when blood glucose is higher than normal, but not high enough for you to be diagnosed with diabetes. Damaged blood vessels may leak fluid and cause swelling. New, weak blood vessels may also begin to grow. These blood vessels can bleed into the middle part of the eye, lead to scarring, or cause dangerously high pressure inside your eye.\nMost serious diabetic eye diseases begin with blood vessel problems. The four eye diseases that can threaten your sight are\nDiabetic retinopathy\nThe retina is the inner lining at the back of each eye. The retina senses light and turns it into signals that your brain decodes, so you can see the world around you. Damaged blood vessels can harm the retina, causing a disease called diabetic retinopathy.\nIn early diabetic retinopathy, blood vessels can weaken, bulge, or leak into the retina. This stage is called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.\nIf the disease gets worse, some blood vessels close off, which causes new blood vessels to grow, or proliferate, on the surface of the retina. This stage is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These abnormal new blood vessels can lead to serious vision problems.\nDiabetic macular edema\nThe part of your retina that you need for reading, driving, and seeing faces is called the macula. Diabetes can lead to swelling in the macula, which is called diabetic macular edema. Over time, this disease can destroy the sharp vision in this part of the eye, leading to partial vision loss or blindness. Macular edema usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy.\nGlaucoma\nGlaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve\u2014the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain. Diabetes doubles the chances of having glaucoma, which can lead to vision loss and blindness if not treated early.\nSymptoms depend on which type of glaucoma you have. Learn more about glaucoma.\nCataracts\nThe lenses within our eyes are clear structures that help provide sharp vision\u2014but they tend to become cloudy as we age. People with diabetes are more likely to develop cloudy lenses, called cataracts. People with diabetes can develop cataracts at an earlier age than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes.\nHow common is diabetic eye disease?\nDiabetic retinopathy\nAbout one in three people with diabetes who are older than age 40 already have some signs of diabetic retinopathy.1 Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Each person\u2019s outlook for the future, however, depends in large part on regular care. Finding and treating diabetic retinopathy early can reduce the risk of blindness by 95 percent.\nGlaucoma and cataracts\nYour chances of developing glaucoma or cataracts are about twice that of someone without diabetes.\nWho is more likely to develop diabetic eye disease?\nAnyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. Your risk is greater with\n- high blood glucose that is not treated\n- high blood pressure that is not treated\nHigh blood cholesterol and smoking may also raise your risk for diabetic eye disease.\nSome groups are affected more than others. African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Hispanics/Latinos, Pacific Islanders, and older adults are at greater risk of losing vision or going blind from diabetes.\nIf you have diabetes and become pregnant, you can develop eye problems very quickly during your pregnancy. If you already have some diabetic retinopathy, it can get worse during pregnancy. Changes that help your body support a growing baby may put stress on the blood vessels in your eyes. Your health care team will suggest regular eye exams during pregnancy to catch and treat problems early and protect your vision.\nDiabetes that occurs only during pregnancy, called gestational diabetes, does not usually cause eye problems. Researchers aren't sure why this is the case.\nYour chances of developing diabetic eye disease increase the longer you have diabetes.\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetic eye disease?\nOften there are no early symptoms of diabetic eye disease. You may have no pain and no change in your vision as damage begins to grow inside your eyes, particularly with diabetic retinopathy.\nWhen symptoms do occur, they may include\n- blurry or wavy vision\n- frequently changing vision\u2014sometimes from day to day\n- dark areas or vision loss\n- poor color vision\n- spots or dark strings (also called floaters)\n- flashes of light\nTalk with your eye doctor if you have any of these symptoms.\nWhen should I see a doctor right away?\nCall a doctor right away if you notice sudden changes to your vision, including flashes of light or many more spots (floaters) than usual. You also should see a doctor right away if it looks like a curtain is pulled over your eyes. These changes in your sight can be symptoms of a detached retina, which is a medical emergency.\nHow do doctors diagnose eye problems from diabetes?\nHaving a full, dilated eye exam is the best way to check for eye problems from diabetes. Your doctor will place drops in your eyes to widen your pupils. This allows the doctor to examine a larger area at the back of each eye, using a special magnifying lens. Your vision will be blurry for a few hours after a dilated exam.\nYour doctor will also\n- test your vision\n- measure the pressure in your eyes\nYour doctor may suggest other tests, too, depending on your health history.\nMost people with diabetes should see an eye care professional once a year for a complete eye exam. Your own health care team may suggest a different plan, based on your type of diabetes and the time since you were first diagnosed.\nHow do doctors treat diabetic eye disease?\nYour doctor may recommend having eye exams more often than once a year, along with management of your diabetes. This means managing your diabetes ABCs, which include your A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol; and quitting smoking. Ask your health care team what you can do to reach your goals.\nDoctors may treat advanced eye problems with medicine, laser treatments, surgery, or a combination of these options.\nMedicine\nYour doctor may treat your eyes with anti-VEGF medicine, such as aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab. These medicines block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye. Anti-VEGF medicines can also stop fluid leaks, which can help treat diabetic macular edema.\nThe doctor will inject an anti-VEGF medicine into your eyes during office visits. You'll have several treatments during the first few months, then fewer treatments after you finish the first round of therapy. Your doctor will use medicine to numb your eyes so you don\u2019t feel pain. The needle is about the thickness of a human hair.\nAnti-VEGF treatments can stop further vision loss and may improve vision in some people.\nLaser Treatment\nLaser treatment, also called photocoagulation, creates tiny burns inside the eye with a beam of light. This method treats leaky blood vessels and extra fluid, called edema. Your doctor usually provides this treatment during several office visits, using medicine to numb your eyes. Laser treatment can keep eye disease from getting worse, which is important to prevent vision loss or blindness. But laser treatment is less likely to bring back vision you\u2019ve already lost compared with anti-VEGF medicines.\nThere are two types of laser treatment:\n- Focal/grid laser treatment works on a small area of the retina to treat diabetic macular edema.\n- Scatter laser treatment, also called panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), covers a larger area of the retina. This method treats the growth of abnormal blood vessels, called proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\nVitrectomy\nVitrectomy is a surgery to remove the clear gel that fills the center of the eye, called the vitreous gel. The procedure treats problems with severe bleeding or scar tissue caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Scar tissue can force the retina to peel away from the tissue beneath it, like wallpaper peeling away from a wall. A retina that comes completely loose, or detaches, can cause blindness.\nDuring vitrectomy, a clear salt solution is gently pumped into the eye to maintain eye pressure during surgery and to replace the removed vitreous. Vitrectomy is done in a surgery center or hospital with pain medicine.\nCataract Lens Surgery\nIn a surgery center or hospital visit, your doctor can remove the cloudy lens in your eye, where the cataract has grown, and replace it with an artificial lens. People who have cataract surgery generally have better vision afterward. After your eye heals, you may need a new prescription for your glasses. Your vision following cataract surgery may also depend on treating any damage from diabetic retinopathy or macular edema.\nWhat can I do to protect my eyes?\nTo prevent diabetic eye disease, or to keep it from getting worse, manage your diabetes ABCs: your A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol; and quit smoking if you smoke. Read more information on how to manage diabetes.\nAlso, have a dilated eye exam at least once a year\u2014or more often if recommended by your eye care professional. These actions are powerful ways to protect the health of your eyes\u2014and can prevent blindness.\nThe sooner you work to manage your diabetes and other health conditions, the better. And, even if you\u2019ve struggled in the past to manage your health, taking better care of yourself now can protect your eyes for the future. It\u2019s never too late to begin.\nWhat if I already have some vision loss from diabetes?\nAsk your eye care professional to help you find a low vision and rehabilitation clinic. Special eye care professionals can help you manage vision loss that cannot be corrected with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery. Special devices and training may help you make the most of your remaining vision so that you can continue to be active, enjoy hobbies, visit friends and family members, and live without help from others.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

You can do a lot to prevent heart disease and stroke by managing your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels; and by not smoking.\nLow Blood Glucose (Hypoglycemia)\nHypoglycemia occurs when your blood glucose drops too low. Certain diabetes medicines make low blood glucose more likely. You can prevent hypoglycemia by following your meal plan and balancing your physical activity, food, and medicines. Testing your blood glucose regularly can also help prevent hypoglycemia.\nDiabetic Neuropathy\nDiabetic neuropathy is nerve damage that can result from diabetes. Different types of nerve damage affect different parts of your body. Managing your diabetes can help prevent nerve damage that affects your feet and limbs, and organs such as your heart.\nKidney Disease\nDiabetic kidney disease, also called diabetic nephropathy, is kidney disease caused by diabetes. You can help protect your kidneys by managing your diabetes and meeting your blood pressure goals.\nFoot Problems\nDiabetes can cause nerve damage and poor blood flow, which can lead to serious foot problems. Common foot problems, such as a callus, can lead to pain or an infection that makes it hard to walk. Get a foot checkup at each visit with your health care team.\nEye Disease\nDiabetes can damage your eyes and lead to low vision and blindness. The best way to prevent eye disease is to manage your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol; and to not smoke. Also, have a dilated eye exam at least once a year.\nGum Disease & Other Dental Problems\nDiabetes can lead to problems in your mouth, such as infection, gum disease, or dry mouth. To help keep your mouth healthy, manage your blood glucose, brush your teeth twice a day, see your dentist at least once a year, and don\u2019t smoke.\nSexual & Bladder Problems\nSexual and bladder problems are more common in people with diabetes. Problems like erectile dysfunction, loss of interest in sex, bladder leaks, and retained urine can happen if diabetes damages your blood vessels and nerves. Treatments are available to help control symptoms and restore intimacy.\nDepression & Diabetes\nDepression is common among people with a chronic, or long-term, illness such as diabetes. Depression can be treated so tell your doctor if you feel sad, hopeless, or anxious.\nCancer & Diabetes\nDiabetes is linked to some types of cancer. Many risk factors for cancer and for diabetes are the same. Not smoking and getting recommended cancer screenings can help prevent cancer.\nDementia & Diabetes\nHigh blood glucose increases the chance of developing dementia. Tell your doctor if you are forgetful because dementia can make it hard to manage your diabetes.\nSleep Apnea & Diabetes\nPeople who have sleep apnea\u2014when you stop breathing for short periods during sleep\u2014are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Sleep apnea also can make diabetes worse.

            "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes": "Healthy Living with Diabetes\nOn this page:\n- How can I plan what to eat or drink when I have diabetes?\n- How can physical activity help manage my diabetes?\n- What can I do to reach or maintain a healthy weight?\n- Should I quit smoking?\n- How can I take care of my mental health?\n- Clinical Trials for Healthy Living with Diabetes\nHealthy living is a way to manage diabetes. To have a healthy lifestyle, take steps now to plan healthy meals and snacks, do physical activities, get enough sleep, and quit smoking or using tobacco products.\nHealthy living may help keep your body\u2019s blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose level, also called blood sugar level, in the range your primary health care professional recommends. Your primary health care professional may be a doctor, a physician assistant, or a nurse practitioner. Healthy living may also help prevent or delay health problems from diabetes that can affect your heart, kidneys, eyes, brain, and other parts of your body.\nMaking lifestyle changes can be hard, but starting with small changes and building from there may benefit your health. You may want to get help from family, loved ones, friends, and other trusted people in your community. You can also get information from your health care professionals.\nHow can I plan what to eat or drink when I have diabetes?\nWhat you choose to eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are parts of a meal plan. Having healthy foods and drinks can help keep your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in the ranges your health care professional recommends. If you have overweight or obesity, a healthy meal plan\u2014along with regular physical activity, getting enough sleep, and other healthy behaviors\u2014may help you reach and maintain a healthy weight. In some cases, health care professionals may also recommend diabetes medicines that may help you lose weight, or weight-loss surgery, also called metabolic and bariatric surgery.\nChoose healthy foods and drinks\nThere is no right or wrong way to choose healthy foods and drinks that may help manage your diabetes. Healthy meal plans for people who have diabetes may include\nTry to choose foods that include nutrients such as vitamins, calcium, fiber, and healthy fats. Also try to choose drinks with little or no added sugar, such as tap or bottled water, low-fat or non-fat milk, and unsweetened tea, coffee, or sparkling water.\nTry to plan meals and snacks that have fewer\n- foods high in saturated fat\n- foods high in sodium, a mineral found in salt\n- sugary foods, such as cookies and cakes, and sweet drinks, such as soda, juice, flavored coffee, and sports drinks\nYour body turns carbohydrates, or carbs, from food into glucose, which can raise your blood glucose level. Some fruits, beans, and starchy vegetables\u2014such as potatoes and corn\u2014have more carbs than other foods. Keep carbs in mind when planning your meals.\nYou should also limit how much alcohol you drink. If you take insulin or certain diabetes medicines, drinking alcohol can make your blood glucose level drop too low, which is called hypoglycemia. If you do drink alcohol, be sure to eat food when you drink and remember to check your blood glucose level after drinking. Talk with your health care team about your alcohol-drinking habits.\nFind the best times to eat or drink\nTalk with your health care professional or health care team about when you should eat or drink. The best time to have meals and snacks may depend on\n- what medicines you take for diabetes\n- what your level of physical activity or your work schedule is\n- whether you have other health conditions or diseases\nAsk your health care team if you should eat before, during, or after physical activity. Some diabetes medicines, such as sulfonylureas or insulin, may make your blood glucose level drop too low during exercise or if you skip or delay a meal.\nPlan how much to eat or drink\nYou may worry that having diabetes means giving up foods and drinks you enjoy. The good news is you can still have your favorite foods and drinks, but you might need to have them in smaller portions or enjoy them less often.\nFor people who have diabetes, carb counting and the plate method are two common ways to plan how much to eat or drink. Talk with your health care professional or health care team to find a method that works for you.\nCarb counting\nCarbohydrate counting, or carb counting, means planning and keeping track of the amount of carbs you eat and drink in each meal or snack. Not all people with diabetes need to count carbs. However, if you take insulin, counting carbs can help you know how much insulin to take.\nPlate method\nThe plate method helps you control portion sizes without counting and measuring. This method divides a 9-inch plate into the following three sections to help you choose the types and amounts of foods to eat for each meal.\n- Nonstarchy vegetables\u2014such as leafy greens, peppers, carrots, or green beans\u2014should make up half of your plate.\n- Carb foods that are high in fiber\u2014such as brown rice, whole grains, beans, or fruits\u2014should make up one-quarter of your plate.\n- Protein foods\u2014such as lean meats, fish, dairy, or tofu or other soy products\u2014should make up one quarter of your plate.\nIf you are not taking insulin, you may not need to count carbs when using the plate method.\nWork with your health care team to create a meal plan that works for you. You may want to have a diabetes educator or a registered dietitian on your team. A registered dietitian can provide medical nutrition therapy, which includes counseling to help you create and follow a meal plan. Your health care team may be able to recommend other resources, such as a healthy lifestyle coach, to help you with making changes. Ask your health care team or your insurance company if your benefits include medical nutrition therapy or other diabetes care resources.\nTalk with your health care professional before taking dietary supplements\nThere is no clear proof that specific foods, herbs, spices, or dietary supplements\u2014such as vitamins or minerals\u2014can help manage diabetes. Your health care professional may ask you to take vitamins or minerals if you can\u2019t get enough from foods. Talk with your health care professional before you take any supplements, because some may cause side effects or affect how well your diabetes medicines work.\nHow can physical activity help manage my diabetes?\nResearch shows that regular physical activity helps people manage their diabetes and stay healthy. Benefits of physical activity may include\n- lower blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels\n- better heart health\n- healthier weight\n- better mood and sleep\n- better balance and memory\nTalk with your health care professional before starting a new physical activity or changing how much physical activity you do. They may suggest types of activities based on your ability, schedule, meal plan, interests, and diabetes medicines. Your health care professional may also tell you the best times of day to be active or what to do if your blood glucose level goes out of the range recommended for you.\nDo different types of physical activity\nPeople with diabetes can be active, even if they take insulin or use technology such as insulin pumps.\nTry to do different kinds of activities. While being more active may have more health benefits, any physical activity is better than none. Start slowly with activities you enjoy. You may be able to change your level of effort and try other activities over time. Having a friend or family member join you may help you stick to your routine.\nThe physical activities you do may need to be different if you are age 65 or older, are pregnant, or have a disability or health condition. Physical activities may also need to be different for children and teens. Ask your health care professional or health care team about activities that are safe for you.\nAerobic activities\nAerobic activities make you breathe harder and make your heart beat faster. You can try walking, dancing, wheelchair rolling, or swimming. Most adults should try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. Aim to do 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. You don\u2019t have to do all 30 minutes at one time. You can break up physical activity into small amounts during your day and still get the benefit.1\nStrength training or resistance training\nStrength training or resistance training may make your muscles and bones stronger. You can try lifting weights or doing other exercises such as wall pushups or arm raises. Try to do this kind of training two times a week.1\nBalance and stretching activities\nBalance and stretching activities may help you move better and have stronger muscles and bones. You may want to try standing on one leg or stretching your legs when sitting on the floor. Try to do these kinds of activities two or three times a week.1\nSome activities that need balance may be unsafe for people with nerve damage or vision problems caused by diabetes. Ask your health care professional or health care team about activities that are safe for you.\nStay safe during physical activity\nStaying safe during physical activity is important. Here are some tips to keep in mind.\nDrink liquids\nDrinking liquids helps prevent dehydration, or the loss of too much water in your body. Drinking water is a way to stay hydrated. Sports drinks often have a lot of sugar and calories, and you don\u2019t need them for most moderate physical activities.\nAvoid low blood glucose\nCheck your blood glucose level before, during, and right after physical activity. Physical activity often lowers the level of glucose in your blood. Low blood glucose levels may last for hours or days after physical activity. You are most likely to have low blood glucose if you take insulin or some other diabetes medicines, such as sulfonylureas.\nAsk your health care professional if you should take less insulin or eat carbs before, during, or after physical activity. Low blood glucose can be a serious medical emergency that must be treated right away. Take steps to protect yourself. You can learn how to treat low blood glucose, let other people know what to do if you need help, and use a medical alert bracelet.\nAvoid high blood glucose and ketoacidosis\nTaking less insulin before physical activity may help prevent low blood glucose, but it may also make you more likely to have high blood glucose. If your body does not have enough insulin, it can\u2019t use glucose as a source of energy and will use fat instead. When your body uses fat for energy, your body makes chemicals called ketones.\nHigh levels of ketones in your blood can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a medical emergency that should be treated right away. DKA is most common in people with type 1 diabetes. Occasionally, DKA may affect people with type 2 diabetes who have lost their ability to produce insulin. Ask your health care professional how much insulin you should take before physical activity, whether you need to test your urine for ketones, and what level of ketones is dangerous for you.\nTake care of your feet\nPeople with diabetes may have problems with their feet because high blood glucose levels can damage blood vessels and nerves. To help prevent foot problems, wear comfortable and supportive shoes and take care of your feet before, during, and after physical activity.\nWhat can I do to reach or maintain a healthy weight?\nIf you have diabetes, managing your weight may bring you several health benefits. Ask your health care professional or health care team if you are at a healthy weight or if you should try to lose weight.\nIf you are an adult with overweight or obesity, work with your health care team to create a weight-loss plan. Losing 5% to 7% of your current weight may help you prevent or improve some health problems and manage your blood glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels.2 If you are worried about your child\u2019s weight and they have diabetes, talk with their health care professional before your child starts a new weight-loss plan.\nYou may be able to reach and maintain a healthy weight by\n- following a healthy meal plan\n- consuming fewer calories\n- being physically active\n- getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night3\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your health care professional may recommend diabetes medicines that may help you lose weight.\nOnline tools such as the Body Weight Planner may help you create eating and physical activity plans. You may want to talk with your health care professional about other options for managing your weight, including joining a weight-loss program that can provide helpful information, support, and behavioral or lifestyle counseling. These options may have a cost, so make sure to check the details of the programs.\nYour health care professional may recommend weight-loss surgery if you aren\u2019t able to reach a healthy weight with meal planning, physical activity, and taking diabetes medicines that help with weight loss.\nIf you are pregnant, trying to lose weight may not be healthy. However, you should ask your health care professional whether it makes sense to monitor or limit your weight gain during pregnancy.\nShould I quit smoking?\nBoth diabetes and smoking\u2014including using tobacco products and e-cigarettes\u2014cause your blood vessels to narrow. Both diabetes and smoking increase your risk of having a heart attack or stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, eye disease, or amputation. Secondhand smoke can also affect the health of your family or others who live with you.\nIf you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help. You don\u2019t have to do it alone.\nHow can I take care of my mental health?\nFeeling stressed, sad, or angry can be common for people with diabetes. Managing diabetes or learning to cope with new information about your health can be hard. People with chronic illnesses such as diabetes may develop anxiety or other mental health conditions.\nLearn healthy ways to lower your stress, and ask for help from your health care team or a mental health professional. While it may be uncomfortable to talk about your feelings, finding a health care professional whom you trust and want to talk with may help you\n- lower your feelings of stress, depression, or anxiety\n- manage problems sleeping or remembering things\n- see how diabetes affects your family, school, work, or financial situation\nAsk your health care team for mental health resources for people with diabetes.\nSleeping too much or too little may raise your blood glucose levels. Your sleep habits may also affect your mental health and vice versa. People with diabetes and overweight or obesity can also have other health conditions that affect sleep, such as sleep apnea, which can raise your blood pressure and risk of heart disease.\nClinical Trials for Healthy Living with Diabetes\nNIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for healthy living with diabetes?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of clinical studies\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help health care professionals and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of healthy living for people with diabetes, such as\n- how changing when you eat may affect body weight and metabolism\n- how less access to healthy foods may affect diabetes management, other health problems, and risk of dying\n- whether low-carbohydrate meal plans can help lower blood glucose levels\n- which diabetes medicines are more likely to help people lose weight\nFind out if clinical trials are right for you.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical trials for healthy living with diabetes are looking for participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on healthy living with diabetes that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at ClinicalTrials.gov. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study.\nReferences\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Adjusted for age group, sex, and racial or ethnic group, the rate was 179.5 per 1 million people.\n- The proportion of end-stage kidney disease with diabetes listed as the primary cause was 39.2% (307,385 out of 783,594 people). As a result, diabetes was the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, followed by high blood pressure (26.7%), glomerulonephritis (14.6%), and cystic kidney disease (5.0%).\n- Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 18\u201364 years.\n- Among US adults aged 18 years or older with diagnosed diabetes, crude data for 2021 indicated:\n- 10.1% (95% CI, 9.6%\u201311.3%) reported severe vision difficulty or blindness.\n- 10.1% (95% CI, 9.6%\u201311.3%) reported severe vision difficulty or blindness.\n- In 2021, diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in the United States.

Estimated percentages and total number of people with diabetes and prediabetes were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), IHS National Data Warehouse (NDW), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), United States Diabetes Surveillance System (USDSS), and U.S. resident population estimates.\nDiagnosed diabetes status was determined from self-reported information provided by survey respondents. Undiagnosed diabetes was determined by measured fasting plasma glucose or A1C levels among people without self-reported diagnosed diabetes. Numbers and rates for acute and long-term complications of diabetes were derived from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), as well as NHIS.\nFor some measures, estimates were not available for certain racial and ethnic subgroups due to small sample sizes.\nDiabetes estimates\nAn alpha level of 0.05 was used when determining statistically significant differences between groups. Age-adjusted estimates were calculated among adults aged 18 years or older by the direct method to the 2000 U.S. Census standard population, using age groups 18\u201344, 45\u201364, and 65 years or older. Most estimates of diabetes in this report do not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, as type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all diabetes cases, the data presented here are more likely to be characteristic of type 2 diabetes, except as noted.\nMore information about the data sources, methods, and references is available in Appendix B: Detailed Methods and Data Sources."

But before people develop type 2 diabetes, they almost always have prediabetes\u2014where blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. It is possible that you may have some of the symptoms of diabetes or even some of the complications.

Even small changes can have a huge impact on delaying or preventing diabetes all together. Work with your health care team to make a plan that works for your lifestyle, or look for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recognized lifestyle change program, guided by a lifestyle coach trained to use a CDC-approved curriculum, where you will meet other people who are working to prevent diabetes.",

            "https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/type-1": "What is type 1 diabetes?\nWhen you have type 1 diabetes, your immune system mistakenly treats the beta cells in your pancreas that create insulin as foreign invaders and destroys them. When enough beta cells are destroyed, your pancreas can\u2019t make insulin or makes so little of it that you need to take insulin to live.\nInsulin is a hormone that helps blood glucose (blood sugar) enter your body\u2019s cells so that it can be used as energy. If you have diabetes, blood glucose can\u2019t enter your cells so it builds up in your bloodstream. This causes high blood glucose (hyperglycemia). Over time, high blood glucose harms your body and can lead to diabetes-related complications if not treated.\nMost of the time, type 1 diabetes is diagnosed in young people, but it can develop in anyone at any age. Scientists and researchers today aren\u2019t sure how to prevent type 1 diabetes or what triggers it.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you can live a long, healthy life by having a strong support system and managing it with your diabetes care team. The treatment plan you develop with your diabetes care team will include insulin, physical activity, and an eating plan to reach your health goals.\nType 1 Diabetes Symptoms\nIf you or your child have the following symptoms of diabetes, let your health care provider know. Symptoms include:\n- Urinating often\n- Feeling very thirsty\n- Feeling very hungry\u2014even though you are eating\n- Extreme fatigue\n- Blurry vision\n- Cuts/bruises that are slow to heal\n- Weight loss\u2014even though you are eating more\nIt\u2019s important to know when you first develop type 1 diabetes, you may not have any symptoms at all.",
            "https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/type-2": "What is Type 2 Diabetes?\nIn type 2 diabetes, your body does not use insulin properly\u2014this is called insulin resistance. At first, your beta cells make extra insulin to make up for it. Over time, your pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin to keep your blood glucose at normal levels. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults but is increasing in young people.\nTreatment for people with type 2 diabetes will include healthy eating and exercise. However, your health care provider may need to also prescribe oral and injectable medications (including insulin) to help you meet your target blood glucose levels.\nSymptoms of Type 2 Diabetes\nThe following symptoms of diabetes are typical. However, some people with type 2 diabetes have symptoms so mild that they go unnoticed.\nCommon symptoms of diabetes:\n- Urinating often\n- Feeling very thirsty\n- Feeling very hungry\u2014even though you are eating\n- Extreme fatigue\n- Blurry vision\n- Cuts/bruises that are slow to heal\n- Tingling, pain, or numbness in the hands/feet\nEarly detection and treatment of diabetes can decrease the risk of developing the complications of diabetes.\nAlthough there are many similarities between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the cause of each is very different.

If you are diagnosed, this doesn't mean you had diabetes before pregnancy nor does it mean you'll have it after giving birth. The key is to act swiftly, remain consistent, and stay on top of your condition. GDM is treatable, manageable, and something you can effectively manage. With your health care provider's support, you can have a healthy pregnancy and baby.\nWhat We Know About GDM\nThe exact cause of GDM is unclear and there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know. But\u2014we do know that the placenta's hormones, which support the baby's growth, can sometimes block the mother\u2019s insulin, leading to insulin resistance. This makes it harder for the body to use insulin effectively, requiring the mother to produce more. If the body can't produce enough insulin during pregnancy, glucose remains in the blood, leading to high blood glucose (blood sugar).\nNo matter the cause, you can work with your health care provider to create a plan that ensures a healthy pregnancy. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek support\u2014there are many effective ways to manage GDM.\nProtecting You and Your Baby\nTake these steps to keep you and your baby healthy:\n- Get screened: Early treatment helps prevent health issues for both you and your baby.

Expand each of the complications below to learn more about them.",
            "https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/devices-technology": "Diabetes technology has come a long way.\nFrom blood glucose meters and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to cutting-edge insulin pumps and more, devices are easier to use and less invasive. There are lots of options so that you can find what works best for you.\nWhat Is a Smart Insulin Pen?\nThe new generation of connected insulin delivery devices may help simplify your routine.\nA smart insulin pen is a reusable injector pen with an intuitive smartphone app that can help people with diabetes better manage insulin delivery. This smart system calculates and tracks doses and provides helpful reminders, alerts, and reports. They can come in the form of an add-on to your current insulin pen or a reusable form which uses prefilled cartridges instead of vials or disposable pens.\nSmart insulin pens are a rapidly growing market. Why? Because they are typically more affordable, easy to use, and offer many benefits and improvements for people who depend upon insulin to manage their diabetes.\nHigh-Tech Help to Better Manage Your Diabetes\nThe biggest challenges for many insulin pen (multiple daily injection) users are:\n- Dose amount: How much to inject\n- Dose timing: Shelf-life, temperature, and storage conditions\n- Insulin quality: Shelf-life, temperature, and storage conditions\nLearn more about smart insulin pens\nChoosing How to Check Your Blood Glucose\nFor most people, checking blood glucose (blood sugar) meter is just a part of life. That\u2019s why getting it right matters.\nThe two main types are blood glucose meters that use a drop of blood to check what your levels are at that moment and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) that check your blood glucose regularly day or night\u2014pick the one that works best for you and your lifestyle.\nOf these two options, there are more choices than ever, from basic designs to more advanced models that have all the bells and whistles. And fancier isn\u2019t necessarily better. Here are some things to consider:\n- Ease of use\u2013Some meters are made for simpler operation, whether it\u2019s larger buttons, illuminated screens or audio capabilities.\n- Cost and insurance coverage\u2013Meters vary in price, and some insurers limit coverage to specific models. Start by checking with your provider to find out what they\u2019ll cover.\n- Information retrieval\u2013Consider how the meter retrieves your information and whether you can download the data to a computer or mobile device to make it easier to share with your diabetes care team.\n- Flexibility\u2013If you\u2019re using a blood glucose meter and are tired of finger pricks, there\u2019s an alternative site monitor that lets you draw blood samples from your arm, thigh, or the palm of your hand.\nFewer Finger Pricks with CGM\nIf you have type 1 or type 2 and just want to manage your blood glucose better, continuous glucose monitoring may be right for you. CGMs report your blood glucose levels in real time (for example every five minutes throughout the day), alert you when your glucose hits a high or a low limit, and provide insight into glucose trends. Learn more about continuous glucose monitoring and time in range.\nCGMs work through a sensor placed on your skin. It transmits readings to a small recording device. Whether you manage your diabetes with a pump, daily injections, or oral medications, a CGM can help you manage your blood glucose.\nIs a CGM right for you?\nMany people with type 1 and type 2 can benefit from using a CGM. Those that would benefit the most are people that have trouble reaching and maintaining target blood glucose. CGMs are particularly useful if you often have lows and are unaware of when they happen (hypoglycemia unawareness).\nEven if you have a good handle on your diabetes management, you still may want to consider using a CGM for the convenience and the elimination of finger pricks. However, you\u2019ll want to keep in mind that if you are managing your diabetes well without the use of a CGM, your insurance may not cover it\u2014they might consider it a non-necessity.\nWhen it comes to choosing the right CGM for you, we are here to help.\nWith Insulin Pumps, It\u2019s Your Choice\nThe important thing to know is that a pump gives you options. You can get a pump, wear it for a time, decide to stop wearing it, and restart it if you think it will fit better with your treatment\u2014work with your insurance to match whatever works for you.\nPumps are an extra piece of hardware attached to your body. They\u2019re programmed to deliver insulin continuously (basal), or as a surge (bolus) dose close to mealtime to control the rise in blood glucose after a meal. They work by closely mimicking your body's normal release of insulin.\nIs a Pump Right for You?\nIf your doctor determines that a pump is a good option for you, it's important to check with your insurance provider before you buy anything. Most insurance providers cover pumps, but sometimes they may not be covered and pumps can be expensive. In addition to cost, some considerations to consider when it comes to getting a pump are lifestyle, commitment, and safety. Learn more about the pros and cons of insulin pumps, and if they may be a good fit for you.\nRemember, using a pump doesn\u2019t mean you no longer have to check your blood glucose. And it can take some getting used to, from setting it up and putting it in to managing it day-to-day. Make sure you\u2019ve spoken with your diabetes care team about how to use your insulin pump correctly and how to check if it\u2019s working properly.\nConnected CGM-Insulin Pumps and \u201cClosed Loop\u201d Systems\nA newer option to consider is using a combination CGM-insulin pump. Your insulin pump will be able to integrate your glucose data from the CGM sensor and either suggest changes to insulin dosing or adjust the appropriate amount of background or basal insulin on its own. This is triggered when you run high (more insulin needed)\u2014or when your blood sugar runs low (insulin needs to be suspended)\u2014so you don\u2019t have to think about it as much. Keep in mind, though, that you will still need to administer insulin for meals.\nWith several existing and emerging options on the market, you can pick the one that works best with your lifestyle and budget.",
            "https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/vaccinations": "Flu Shots\nHaving the flu can be dangerous for anyone. But it is extra risky for people with diabetes or other chronic health problems. Having diabetes means having more instances of high blood glucose (blood sugar) than a person without diabetes. High blood glucose hinders your white blood cells\u2019 ability to fight infections.\nBeyond people living with diabetes, flu is also extra risky for people with heart disease, smokers and those with chronic lung disease, people who have an impaired immune system (like those going through chemotherapy, or who are organ donation recipients), very young children, and people living in very close quarters, such as college dorms, military barracks, or nursing homes.\nShould you get a flu shot?\nIn general, every person with diabetes needs a flu shot each year. Talk with your doctor about having a flu shot. Flu shots do not give 100% protection, but they do make it less likely for you to catch the flu for about six months.\nFor extra safety, it's a good idea for the people you live with or spend a lot of time with to get a flu shot, too. You are less likely to get the flu if the people around you don't have it.\nThe best time to get your flu shot is beginning in September. The shot takes about two weeks to take effect.\nIf you\u2019re sick (such as having a cold or fever), ask if you should wait until you are healthy again before having your flu shot. And don't get a flu shot if you are allergic to eggs.\nYou are advised to continue to take the general precautions of preventing seasonal flu and other communicable illnesses and diseases:\n- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash. If you don\u2019t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand.\n- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.\n- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. Germs spread that way.\n- Try to avoid close contact with sick people.\n- If you get sick, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from infecting them.\nMany illnesses and diseases spread through contact with body fluids. This contact is commonly through being coughed on. Other close contact with an infected person, such as hugging or kissing them, can lead to the spread as well.\nWhat to do if you have diabetes and symptoms of flu\nTalk with your doctor now about how to reach him or her if you think you have the flu. Symptoms of influenza can include:\n- Fever\n- Cough\n- Sore throat\n- Runny or stuffy nose\n- Body aches\n- Headache\n- Chills\n- Fatigue\n- Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea\nPeople may be infected with the flu and have respiratory symptoms without a fever.\nPneumococcal diseases & pneumonia shots\nThere is a category of diseases called pneumococcal disease, of which pneumonia is one of the most dangerous\u2014the other most dangerous being meningitis. People with diabetes are about three times more likely to die with flu and pneumococcal diseases, yet most don\u2019t get a simple, safe pneumonia shot.\nSymptoms of pneumonia include:\n\u2022 Cough that can produce mucus that is gray, yellow, or streaked with blood\n\u2022 Chest pain\n\u2022 Rapid or difficult breathing\n\u2022 Fever\n\u2022 Chills\nSymptoms of meningitis include:\n\u2022 Fever and chills\n\u2022 A stiff, immovable neck that gets progressively worse\n\u2022 Severe headache\n\u2022 Confusion\n\u2022 Photophobia (eye sensitivity to light)\n\u2022 Lethargy to the point of being unresponsive\nA pneumonia shot is a safe and effective way to protect you against getting these illnesses, so the most important step you can take in preventing pneumococcal infection is to get vaccinated. Talk to your doctor about a plan to get vaccinated. Factors for which vaccine is right for you include your age and if you've already received one. Typically, you\u2019ll get one vaccine, wait a year, and then get the second immunization.\nRespiratory Syncytial Virus\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause serious problems for people living with diabetes, especially older adults. RSV is a common infection that can lead to severe complications, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis.\nSymptoms of RSV can include:\n- Runny nose\n- Decrease in appetite\n- Coughing\n- Sneezing\n- Fever\n- Wheezing\nIf you have diabetes, you are more likely to get RSV and its complications because your immune system might be weakened and less effective. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to protect yourself against RSV. And, being vaccinated also helps prevent you from spreading the virus to others around you.\nAdults over 60 can receive one dose of a RSV vaccine per year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting vaccinated in the late summer or early fall.\nOther recommended vaccines\n- Tdap vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis)\n- Hepatitis B vaccine (in three parts)\n- Zoster vaccine (shingles)\n- COVID-19\nPaying for vaccines\nBoth the pneumonia and meningitis vaccines are covered by Medicare Part B if the vaccines are given one year apart. Learn more at medicare.gov/coverage/pneumococcal-shots.\nMost private insurance programs cover pneumococcal vaccines at low or no cost. The Vaccines for Children program covers the vaccine for those 19 and younger if they\u2019re Medicaid-eligible, uninsured or underinsured, or American Indian or Alaska Native.

            "https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-myths": "Diabetes can be confusing, but we are committed to helping you understand the facts about diabetes. The following questions will help clear up diabetes myths you may have heard.\nQ: If you\u2019re overweight, will you always develop type 2 diabetes?\nA: Being overweight is a risk factor for developing diabetes, but other risk factors such as how much physical activity you get, family history, ethnicity, and age also play a role. Unfortunately, many people think that weight is the only risk factor for type 2 diabetes, but many people with type 2 diabetes are at a normal weight or only moderately overweight.\nQ: Do sugary drinks cause diabetes?\nA: Research has also shown that drinking sugary drinks is linked to type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends that people avoid drinking sugar-sweetened beverages and switch to water whenever possible to help prevent type 2 diabetes.\nSugary drinks also raise blood glucose (blood sugar) and can provide several hundred calories in just one serving. Just one 12-ounce can of regular soda has about 150 calories and 40 grams of sugar, a type of carbohydrate (carb). This is the same as 10 teaspoons of sugar.\nSugar-sweetened beverages include beverages like:\n- Regular soda\n- Fruit punch\n- Fruit drinks\n- Energy drinks\n- Sports drinks\n- Sweet tea\n- Sweetened coffee drinks\n- Other sugary drinks\nQ: Is diabetes a serious disease?\nA: Yes. Diabetes causes more deaths per year than breast cancer and AIDS combined and having diabetes nearly doubles your chance of having a heart attack. The good news is that managing your diabetes can reduce your risk for diabetes complications.\nQ: Do people with diabetes need to eat special foods?\nA: No, you don\u2019t need special food. A healthy meal plan for people with diabetes is generally the same as healthy eating for anyone. In fact, there are a lot of different eating plans that can help you manage your diabetes. In general, a healthy eating plan for diabetes will include lots of non-starchy vegetables, limit added sugars, swap refined grains for whole grains and prioritize whole foods over highly processed foods when possible.\nWant to add more veggies and whole foods, but don\u2019t know where to start? Try Diabetes Food Hub\u00ae!\nQ: If you have diabetes, can you eat starchy foods, such as bread, potatoes, and pasta?\nA: Starchy foods can be part of a healthy meal plan, but portion size is key. These foods tend to have more carbs and eating them will raise your blood glucose.\nQ: Do people with diabetes need to avoid carbs?\nA: There is no evidence to suggest that people with diabetes need to avoid carbs, though some people choose eating plans that avoid them. In fact, the evidence suggests that including the right amounts of carbs, protein, and fat can help manage your blood glucose. Working with your health care team can help you find the right balance for you.\nQ: Not sure where to start\u2026?\nA: Aim for a portion no bigger than a quarter of a 9-inch plate.\nQ: Can people with diabetes eat sweets or chocolate?\nA: If eaten as part of a healthy meal plan sweets and desserts can be eaten by people with diabetes. The key to sweets is to have a very small portion and save them for special occasions so you focus your meals on healthier foods. Working with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) or diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) will help you determine an individualized meal plan that takes into account your goals as well as your likes and dislikes.\nQ: Can you catch diabetes from someone else?\nA: No. Although we don't know exactly why some people develop diabetes and others don\u2019t, we know diabetes is not contagious. It can't be caught like a cold or flu.\nQ: Are people with diabetes more likely to get colds and other illnesses?\nA: You are no more likely to get a cold or another illness if you have diabetes. People with diabetes are advised to get flu shots. This is because any illness can make diabetes more difficult to control, and people with diabetes who get the flu are more likely than others to go on to develop serious complications.\nQ: If you have type 2 diabetes and your doctor says you need to start using insulin, does it mean you're failing to take care of your diabetes properly?\nA: Using insulin to get blood glucose levels to a healthy level is a good thing, not a bad one. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease. When first diagnosed, many people with type 2 diabetes can keep their blood glucose at a healthy level with a combination of meal planning, physical activity, and taking oral medications. But over time, the body gradually produces less and less of its own insulin, and eventually, oral medications may not be enough to keep blood glucose levels in a healthy range.",

This range is important because it helps protect your body from diabetes-related complications. But what happens when your level drops below your target range?\nWhat Is Low Blood Glucose (Hypoglycemia)?\nFor people living with type 1 diabetes or are taking insulin, you should be regularly checking your blood glucose levels.

The Economic Report, which is published every five years, found that the total annual cost of diabetes in 2022 is $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in indirect costs. People with diagnosed diabetes now account for one of every four health care dollars spent in the U.S.\n\u201cWe now know that medical costs for people living with diabetes increased by 35% over the past 10 years.

November is American Diabetes Month\u00ae, and as we continue our fight to end diabetes, we urge policymakers and the entire health care system to see this report as a call to action to prioritize affordable diabetes care.\u201d\nThe Economic Report includes data on diabetes prevalence, total direct medical costs, and average annual medical expenditures. Primary cost drivers include increased use of prescription medications beyond glucose lowering medications, hospital inpatient services, reduced work productivity, and unemployment.\nAdditional topline findings include:\n- After adjusting for inflation, the direct medical cost of diabetes increased by 7% between 2017 and 2022.\n- National health care costs attributable to diabetes have increased by $80 billion in the past 10 years\u2014from $227 billion in 2012 to $307 billion in 2022.\n- On average, people with diagnosed diabetes have medical expenditures 2.6 times higher than would be expected without diabetes.\n- The inflation adjusted cost of insulin increased 24% from 2017 to 2022.\n- Spending on insulin tripled in the past 10 years\u2014increasing from $8 billion in 2012 to $22.3 billion in 2022.\n- After adjusting for inflation, the total cost of insulin and other medications to manage blood glucose increased by 26% from 2017 to 2022.\n- Despite having a lower prevalence rate, women with diabetes spend more on average than men on annual health care expenditures.\n- Black Americans with diabetes pay the most in direct health care expenditures.\n- People with diabetes above the age of 65 spend roughly double on per capita annual health care expenditures than any other age group above the age of 18.\n- $106.3 billion (26%) of the total estimated national cost of diabetes can be attributed to lost productivity at work, unemployment from chronic disability, and premature mortality.\n- Presenteeism, or reduced work productivity, accounts for $35.8 billion in annual indirect costs.\n- Absenteeism, or missed workdays, accounts for $5.4 billion in annual indirect costs.\n- If people with diabetes participated in the workforce like peers without diabetes, there would be 2 million more people between the ages of 18 and 65 in the workforce.\nThe authors of the Economic Report included a multidisciplinary team of leading U.S. experts in the field of diabetes care and costs, including physicians, epidemiologists, endocrinologists, health care researchers, economists, data scientists, and academics.\nThe full Economic Costs of Diabetes in the US in 2022 report is available online and will appear in the December issue of ADA journal, Diabetes Care\u00ae.\n# # #\nAbout the American Diabetes Association\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) is the nation\u2019s leading voluntary health organization fighting to bend the curve on the diabetes epidemic and help people living with diabetes thrive.

            "https://diabetes.org/getting-sick-with-diabetes/sick-days": "When you get sick with things like colds or the flu, the illness and stress from it causes your body to release hormones that raise blood glucose (blood sugar) levels, making it harder to keep your blood glucose in your target range.\nAnd while having diabetes does not make you more likely to get a cold or flu, it does raise your chances of getting seriously sick. Having a plan for sick days ahead of time will help you manage your diabetes and will make additional complications less likely.\nOne thing to keep in mind is to be sure you\u2019re getting enough water\u2014so drink plenty of it. If you\u2019re having trouble keeping water down, have small sips every 15 minutes or so throughout the day.\nYou\u2019ll also want to be sure to get your annual flu shot to make getting the flu less likely.\nManage your blood glucose\nBeing sick can make it hard to eat. Having simple carbs handy like regular soda, Jell-O, or popsicles will help keep your blood glucose up if you are at risk for lows. Use the 15-15 rule to treat the lows you may have. Making sure your blood glucose remains in target is one of the best ways to help your body deal with sickness.\nWatch for signs of DKA\nIf your body does not have the proper amount of insulin, you run the risk of your body producing too many ketones, which puts you at risk of developing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We recommend testing for ketones every four to six hours when you\u2019re feeling sick.\nThe following are warning signs of DKA. If you experience any of these, contact your doctor immediately.\n- High blood glucose\n- High ketones\n- Thirst or dry mouth\n- Frequent urination\n- Drowsiness\n- Dry or flushed skin\n- Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain\n- Difficulty breathing\n- Fruity odor on breath\n- Confusion\nNOTE: Severe DKA that goes untreated can cause coma or death.\nHave a plan\nBefore you get sick, decide on an action plan with your health care team. This plan should include the following:\n- When to call your doctor (in most cases if you are vomiting or have diarrhea more than three times over 24 hours or have had a fever over 101\u00b0 for 24 hours).\n- How often to check your blood glucose.\n- What foods and fluids to take during your illness.\n- How to adjust your insulin or oral medication, if you need to.\n- If and when you need to check for ketones.\n- Discuss what over the counter medications you should use for colds, flu, etc. Some can raise your blood glucose or affect your usual medications.\nAfter you\u2019ve discussed these topics with your diabetes care team, be sure to write your plan down to reference when you\u2019re feeling sick. You will also want to keep a list of emergency information such as your doctor\u2019s phone number, a list of medications you\u2019re taking, and your insurance information.\nCreate a Sick-Day Kit\nIf you do get sick, it'll make things easier if you already have a sick-day kit ready to go with the things you'll need. You might want to include:\n- A glucose meter\n- Extra batteries\n- Supplies for your insulin pump or continuous glucose monitor\n- Ketone test strips\n- A week\u2019s worth of glucose-lowering medication (don\u2019t store these longer than 30 days before use)\n- Glucose tabs or gels\n- Flu or cold medications that won\u2019t disrupt your diabetes management",

Because when you\u2019re active, your cells become more sensitive to insulin so it works more effectively to lower your blood glucose, also known as blood sugar. (You might notice that exercising sometimes raises your blood glucose, find out why.)\nExercise just makes you feel better. So, however you want to do it\u2014taking regular walks around the block, going for a run, or signing up for a marathon\u2014getting started is the most important part.\nHow to get started exercising safely\nIt doesn\u2019t matter where you are physically. If you\u2019ve never set foot in a gym, that\u2019s okay\u2014as long as you start doing something now. If you haven\u2019t been very active or are worried about your health, it\u2019s important to consult your doctor and start slowly.\nLight walking is a great place to start\u2014and a great habit to incorporate into your life. Walk with a loved one, with your dog, or just by yourself while listening to an audio book. Set goals every day and meet them and you\u2019ll start feeling like you\u2019re back in control of your life. Learn more about how to get started safely.\nEven little changes make a big difference\nIf you\u2019re still struggling with getting started or feeling overwhelmed by the idea of starting a more active life, take heart: every change, no matter how small, makes a difference in your ability to manage diabetes.

And keeping an open mind helps, too.\nMore on Type 2 Diabetes Medications\nAll About Insulin\nType 1 diabetes means using insulin. However, if you have type 2 diabetes, treatment plans can change depending on who you are. Some people can manage it with healthy eating and exercise, or with oral medications, while others may also need to use insulin.\nIt\u2019s common for your medication needs to change over time. And that\u2019s a good thing. The most important thing is to get to feeling your best.\nA Quick Guide to Insulin\nIf you\u2019re just starting out with insulin, it can take a little getting used to. With a little practice, you\u2019ll be a pro in no time.\nInsulin is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by your pancreas. If you are prescribed insulin, it may be because your body doesn\u2019t produce it (type 1 diabetes) or your body doesn\u2019t use it properly (type 2 diabetes).\nThere are many different types of insulin sold in the United States, which differ in how they\u2019re made, how they work in the body, and how much they cost. It\u2019s also available in different strengths\u2014most commonly, U-100. Your doctor will help you find the right type of insulin for your health needs.\nWhen it comes to syringes, your doctor will advise on which capacity you need based on your insulin dose. In general, smaller capacity syringes can be easier to read and draw an accurate dose. Here are some tips:\n- If your largest dose is close to the syringe's maximum capacity, consider buying the next size up in case your dosage changes\n- If you need to measure doses in half units, be sure to choose a syringe that has these markings\n- If you're traveling outside of the United States, be certain to match your insulin strength with the correct size syringe",

The good news is, you can lower your chances of complications by managing your blood glucose levels and taking care of your feet.\nPreventing Foot Issues\nManaging Foot Issues\nDiabetes can cause nerve damage. Lost sensitivity in the feet can make it difficult to know when you're hurt or injured and even the smallest cuts and scrapes can become difficult to heal. To help prevent foot complications that can come with diabetes, it's important to have the right information to make smart choices and connect with expert diabetes advice\nPoor circulation (blood flow) can make your foot less able to fight infection and heal. Diabetes causes blood vessels of the foot and leg to narrow and harden.\nQuick Tip: Compression socks gently apply\nDiabetes can cause changes in the skin of your foot.

Plaque, which is made up of cholesterol and other substances, causes the arteries to harden. The medical term for this is atherosclerosis. When plaque continues to build, the arteries narrow, therefore reducing the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.

By continuing to deny it, you run the risk of not taking action to fight the disease and keep yourself healthy.\nAn important part of steering out of denial is recognizing how it sounds in your head\u2014and how it makes you avoid critical care. If you catch yourself saying or thinking any of the following phrases, you may be in denial:\n- \u201cOne bite won\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n- \u201cThis sore will heal itself.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019ll go to the doctor later.\u201d\n- \u201cI don\u2019t have time to do it.\u201d\n- \u201cMy diabetes isn\u2019t serious.\u201d\nEveryone goes into denial from time to time\u2014but there are things you can do to make sure you don\u2019t stay there.

            "https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/keeping-your-mouth-healthy": "Your mouth doesn\u2019t lie. Swollen, bleeding, or receding gums; loose or missing teeth; and persistent bad breath are all signs of gum disease. If you have diabetes, you\u2019re at higher risk for both gingivitis (early-stage gum disease) and periodontitis (advanced gum disease).\nBoth start with plaque, a soft, sticky substance that accumulates on your teeth as you eat and is made up mostly of bacteria. More than 500 types of bacteria can be found in plaque\u2014some are good for your mouth and some aren\u2019t.\nBacteria in a person with diabetes is no different than people without doesn\u2019t have diabetes. The difference is in the nature and intensity of the body\u2019s inflammatory response to the bacteria. If you have diabetes\u2014especially if you\u2019re not meeting your targets\u2014you will have more of an inflammatory response, which could result in a loss of supporting tissue for your teeth. Eventually, the tooth could become so loose it has to be removed.\nThere are some oral conditions that are more common in people with diabetes, such as dry mouth. It may be a result of aging or medications, but it could also be a complication of diabetes. Whatever the cause, the lack of saliva from dry mouth means food debris, sugar, acid and bacteria don\u2019t get washed away as easily.\nThere is good news, though: None of this happens right away. And there\u2019s plenty you can do to prevent gum disease. If you manage your diabetes and your oral health by getting regular checkups with a dentist or periodontist, you will reduce your risk.\nWhat Can You Do Now?\nHere are three essential steps to maintaining a healthy smile:\n- Brush twice a day. The American Dental Association recommends brushing for two minutes, twice a day, with a fluoride toothpaste. Place your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gums and gently move the brush back and forth along the outer, inner and chewing surfaces of your teeth. Be sure to clean each surface thoroughly. Whether you use a manual or electric brush doesn\u2019t matter, but the size and shape of your brush should make it easy to reach all areas. And be sure to use soft bristles. Research shows that firm bristles tend to wear away the enamel on your teeth.\n- Floss once a day. If you don\u2019t, plaque and food particles build up between teeth and along the gum line, setting you up for tooth decay and gum disease. To floss, wind an 18-inch piece around your middle fingers, leaving an inch or two to work with. Holding the floss between your thumbs and index fingers, curve it around each tooth in a C shape and gently slide it up and down the tooth and beneath the gum line. Not a fan of flossing? Try an interdental device. The tiny brush is designed to reach places a regular toothbrush can\u2019t.\n- See your dentist twice a year. Depending on the health of your gums, he or she may recommend cleanings every three months. Your dentist may also suggest an antibacterial mouth rinse or antibiotics. Be sure to let your dentist know of any changes in your health or medications because both can affect your oral health\u2014such as symptoms of dry mouth.\nKnow Before You Go\nCheck out these four ways to get the most out of your next dental appointment:\n- Find a dentist who is aware of the needs of people with diabetes.\n- Be honest with your dentist. Your dentist needs to know if you\u2019ve been reaching your diabetes targets since it will affect how you\u2019ll respond to dental treatments.\n- Be sure to eat normally prior to your appointment and take your usual meds on schedule.\n- Be proactive. When you go in for a cleaning, ask: How do my gums look? Was there a lot of bleeding? Is there anything more I should be doing? You\u2019re the most important part of your diabetes care team\u2014and that\u2019s also true when it comes to keeping your teeth and gums healthy.\nDid You Know?\nDid you know that it\u2019s possible for your dentist to refer you to your doctor to get screened for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes? A study published recently in BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care found that nearly 1 in 5 people with severe gum disease may have had type 2 diabetes and didn\u2019t know it.",

Food fuels the body and is a key part of diabetes management. However, no matter what eating plan you follow, there are some basic guidelines that apply across the board.\nWhat all healthy eating plans have in common:\n- Non-starchy vegetables as a foundation for the plate\n- Lean proteins and plant-based sources of protein\n- Quality carbohydrates like starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat milk\n- Less added sugar\n- Healthy fats\n- Less processed foods\n- Water or zero-calorie beverages\nUse the Diabetes Plate for Meal Planning\nSimplify healthy eating with the Diabetes Plate\u2014 a low-carb meal pattern jumpstart that helps you portion your plate and support your diabetes management.

These vegetables keep you feeling full for longer and provide you with the great-tasting nutrients your body needs without as many calories and carbs. Non-starchy vegetables include broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, and more! Learn more about non-starchy vegetables.\nProtein\nProtein is an important part of a diabetes meal plan. Are you plant-based? That\u2019s okay! There are plenty of protein-rich plant-based options, such as beans, hummus, lentils, and others. However, many legumes do have carbs which can have an impact on your diabetes management. Learn about your best choices.\nFruits\nWondering if you can eat fruit? Yes! While fruit does count as a carbohydrate food, they are loaded with vitamins, minerals, and fiber just like vegetables. Fruit can also help you satisfy your sweet tooth without the added sugar. Find out about the best choices.\nFats\nFocus on adding healthy fats (like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) to help lower your cholesterol and protect your heart.

            "https://diabetes.org/food-nutrition/food-insecurity-diabetes": "A food desert is a term used for decades by researchers to describe areas of the country, often poor or remote, where healthy food choices are hard to find. Often there is just one, small grocery store, residents have limited transportation options and there is usually a high concentration of people with diabetes in these areas.\nThe lack of access to healthy food reflects a larger problem in America: food insecurity. Food insecurity is a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life and it\u2019s an issue that touches people of all ages with all types of diabetes.\nWhat is the diabetes link?\nWhether it\u2019s the result of too many empty calories or not enough nutritious ones, research shows that food insecurity in all its forms is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nFor most Americans experiencing food insecurity, the problem isn\u2019t that they\u2019re getting too few calories, it\u2019s that they\u2019re getting too many of the wrong kind. Usually, the cheapest and most readily available foods (fatty, fried takeout, high-sodium prepared meals, candy and soft drinks) provide plenty of calories, but they contribute to or make it hard to properly manage chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and diabetes.\nThat\u2019s why researchers and food policy experts have begun moving away from the term food desert. Neighborhoods that lack supermarkets may still have a lot of places where residents can buy food\u2014it\u2019s just not very good food.\nDiabetes may be tied to food insecurity in other ways, too. For some people, diabetes may be the cause of their food insecurity, not just the result. For example, someone with complications from diabetes may have a harder time holding down a job. And people on limited budgets might have to make hard choices between meals and medication to manage their diabetes.\nFor adults and children who already have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, food insecurity can also increase the risk of complications. If you start skipping meals, for example, it can disrupt your blood glucose (also known as blood sugar) levels and put you at higher risk of hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose. On the other side, those with diabetes who can afford only unhealthy fare may have more frequent high blood glucose levels, which can raise the risk of long-term complications.\nEliminating food insecurity would go a long way toward reducing the burden of diabetes. But researchers are quick to point out that food insecurity, like poverty, won\u2019t be an easy problem to fix.\nWho\u2019s at risk?\nThe focus on food insecurity in inner cities has expanded to recognize that there are other groups that may have a hard time accessing healthy food. People in small towns and rural areas, for example, can face long drives to supermarkets with limited stock.\nOlder adults are another group that is particularly vulnerable to food insecurity and diabetes alike, and diabetes is a major concern among older adults who depend on food banks. After all, it\u2019s tough to manage your diabetes if you can\u2019t afford the right foods.\nFresh produce and proteins often aren\u2019t available to older adults on a tight budget or to those with mobility issues. Food boxes, for example, are often full of carbs with low-cost items like juice, pasta and white rice are standard.\nAnd accessing the right types of food isn\u2019t the only issue. Preparing food from scratch can be equally tough. Many seniors are unable to stand, or arthritis might make chopping hard. Because of this, older adults often depend on sandwiches, canned soups or meals they can microwave.\nThat\u2019s not to say hunger can\u2019t still play a role. Many people who rely on public assistance for all or part of their food budgets may not be able to stretch their money to last until their next assistance payment.\nFind food assistance resources.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to eat properly on a limited budget, or for other reasons, there are resources that can help. Your community may have a food bank program or food pantry. Or you may qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a USDA program that provides food aid to those in need.\nFind resources for diabetes care. Talk to your doctor or diabetes educator about your situation. They may be able to prescribe lower-cost medications or refer you to programs designed to help with prescription costs.

Your body uses that glucose for fuel to keep you going throughout the day. This is what you probably know of as your \u201cblood glucose\u201d or \u201cblood sugar.\u201d When it comes to managing diabetes, the carbs you eat play an important role. After your body breaks down those carbs into glucose, your pancreas releases insulin to help your cells absorb that glucose.\nWhen someone\u2019s blood glucose is too high, it is called hyperglycemia. There are a few causes for \u201chighs,\u201d including not having enough insulin in your body to process the glucose in the blood or the cells in your body not effectively reacting to the insulin that is released, leaving extra glucose in the blood. A low blood glucose is known as hypoglycemia. \u201cLows\u201d can sometimes be caused by not consuming enough carbohydrates, or an imbalance in medications. In short, the carbs we consume impact our blood glucose\u2014so balance is key!\nCarbohydrates in food\nThere are three main types of carbohydrates in food\u2014starches, sugar, and fiber. As you\u2019ll see on the nutrition labels for the food you buy, the term \u201ctotal carbohydrate\u201d refers to all three of these types. The goal is to choose carbs that are nutrient-dense, which means they are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, and low in added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats. When choosing carbohydrate foods:\n- Eat the most of these: whole, unprocessed, non-starchy vegetables. Non-starchy vegetables like lettuce, cucumbers, broccoli, tomatoes, and green beans have a lot of fiber and very little carbohydrate, which results in a smaller impact on your blood glucose. Remember, these should make up half your plate according to the Plate Method!\n- Eat some of these: whole, minimally processed carbohydrate foods. These are your starchy carbohydrates, and include fruits like apples, blueberries, strawberries and cantaloupe; whole intact grains like brown rice, whole wheat bread, whole grain pasta and oatmeal; starchy vegetables like corn, green peas, sweet potatoes, pumpkin and plantains; and beans and lentils like black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas and green lentils. If you\u2019re using the Plate Method, foods in this category should make up about a quarter of your plate.\n- Try to eat less of these: refined, highly processed carbohydrate foods and those with added sugar. These include sugary drinks like soda, sweet tea and juice, refined grains like white bread, white rice and sugary cereal, and sweets and snack foods like cake, cookies, candy and chips.",

See our commercial driving and diabetes page for more information.\nThere are steps that people with diabetes can and should take when operating a motor vehicle to avoid low blood glucose levels while driving.\nTips for driving with diabetes\nPreparation is essential!\nBefore you get a license:\n- Check your state DMV to learn more about the laws and policies that may affect you.\nBefore you drive:\n- Check your blood glucose before driving.\n- If it's low, treat the hypoglycemia and wait until you're at a safe level before driving.\n- Keep fast-acting carbohydrates such as glucose tablets or a juice box and extra snacks in the car.\n- If you start feeling low while you're driving, pull over safely and check your blood glucose. Checking your blood glucose or treating a high or low reading should not be done while driving.\n- If low, don't begin driving again until you have treated it and your blood glucose is back to a safe level.\n- In case of an emergency, having glucagon and extra diabetes supplies such as a spare meter, test strips, and pump supplies in the car is a smart move.\n- If you have one, wear your diabetes medical ID or have your Diabetes Alert Card in your wallet. These can help first responders treat you more quickly.\nFor health care providers and attorneys\nThe American Diabetes Association\u2019s Statement on Diabetes and Driving, provides an overview of existing licensing rules for people with diabetes, addresses the factors that impact driving for this population, and identifies general guidelines for assessing driver fitness and determining appropriate licensing restrictions.

            "https://diabetes.org/advocacy/federal-connected-congress": "The American Diabetes Association urges Congress to make diabetes a priority.\nTackling system reform, health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid issues on Capitol Hill, federal advocacy helps the American Diabetes Association (ADA) achieve federal legislative goals that allow people with diabetes coverage and access to the treatments and services they need to manage diabetes.\nCongressional Diabetes Caucus\nThe mission of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus is to educate Members of Congress and their staff about diabetes and to support legislative activities that would improve diabetes research education and treatment.\nInsulin Affordability\nEnsuring insulin is affordable and accessible for those who need it to live is a top priority for the American Diabetes Association (ADA). One in five Americans with diabetes reports rationing insulin to pay for other life essentials like rent, utilities, childcare, and food.1 This is why the ADA has been the leading advocate for cost-sharing limits on insulin at the state and federal levels.\nTo date, 25 states, the District of Columbia, and Medicare Part D have instituted cost sharing limits on insulin prescriptions. While these limits have brought economic relief to people on Medicare and state health care programs, federal legislation has the potential to bring economic relief to millions more.\nOver the past several years, the ADA has worked to advance important changes to insulin coverage that would make the lifesaving medication more affordable for individuals and families, regardless of their health insurance. The ADA supports a federal limit of $35 on the monthly out-of-pocket costs on insulin for Americans with commercial insurance plans.\nFederal Funding for Diabetes Research and Programs\nThe ADA urges Congress to ensure funding for diabetes research and prevention is a national priority. Robust funding for federal programs is critical to achieving significant advancements in prevention, treatment, and ultimately a cure for diabetes. These federal programs include:\n- The National Institutes of Health\u2019s (NIH\u2019s):\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\n- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC\u2019s):\n- Division of Diabetes Translation (DDT)\n- National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP)\nDiabetes is the nation's most expensive chronic disease, costing our economy $413 billion annually.2 Unfortunately, 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes each year.3\nWe must intensify our efforts to stop diabetes from impacting more families and overwhelming our economy. Through robust federal resources for prevention, treatment, and research, we can stem the tide of the diabetes epidemic.\nAccess to Resources and Care\nFood insecurity is linked to both the development and progression of diabetes.4 With 13.5 million families in the U.S. experiencing food insecurity, ensuring access to nutritious and affordable foods is critical to preventing and managing diabetes.5 During pregnancy, food insecurity increases the risk for gestational diabetes (GDM).6 The ADA is educating Congress about the impact federal spending reductions on vital nutrition assistance programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), will have on individuals and families with diabetes or prediabetes.\nSimilarly, access to health care coverage is vital for people with diabetes and prediabetes. Research shows that adults with diabetes with health insurance have better glucose and cholesterol management than those without insurance.7 Almost 24% of people with diabetes rely on Medicaid to provide access to diabetes care, medications, and technology.\nAccording to an evaluation of National Health And Nutrition (NHANES), job loss or change was reported to be the most common reason for not having insurance.8 Almost one-third of participants indicated they did not have coverage because they were not eligible for Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or other public coverage.9 The ADA needs your help to protect these critical health and nutrition programs. Join us by contacting your member of Congress today.\nAddressing the Obesity Epidemic\nThere is an urgent need to address the obesity epidemic in America. Research has shown that obesity affects nearly 42% of the adult population and accounts for up to 53% of new cases of type 2 diabetes every year.10 There is strong and consistent evidence that effective obesity treatment can delay the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and is highly beneficial in treating type 2 diabetes.\nRecognizing this connection, the ADA announced the launch of a new division, the Obesity Association, in 2024 to bring greater focus on addressing the prevention, care, and treatment gap. The ADA supports expanding access to evidence-based obesity treatment for individuals enrolled in federal and state health care programs to curtail this disease. By removing barriers to evidence-based treatment\u2014including nutrition intervention, obesity medications, and care\u2014the health and economic consequences can be reduced and even avoided.\nWe Want to Hear from You\nOur goal is to educate lawmakers about issues important to people living with diabetes and/or obesity and remain in contact with them at crucial times during the year. Members of Congress want to hear from you\u2014their constituents\u2014to understand your priorities. Your story supports the cause of the diabetes community on Capitol Hill.\nFor more information contact: Raiseyourvoice@diabetes.org\nReferences\n1. Herkert D, Vijayakumar P, Luo J, et al.

They have become popular and more accurate over the years and are now considered a viable treatment option for people with diabetes.\nAdvances in Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) technology have made our lives easier, and that goes for people with diabetes as well. Insulin administration and blood glucose (blood sugar) monitoring have transformed from multiple finger pricks in a day to a few swipes on a cell phone. With a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), one can see in real time if they\u2019re trending high or low and take preventative measures against hypo and hyperglycemia. Real time CGM monitoring has led to tremendous outcomes for people with diabetes who, without a CGM, may have experienced potentially life-threatening complications.\nWith the benefits and ease of use that a CGM provides, it would be natural to assume everyone with diabetes has one, or at least has access to one. That however is not the case, studies show that poorer, older, Black and Brown Americans and Americans on Medicaid have less access to CGMs than their counterparts.

Your voice is a powerful tool when it\u2019s used to speak up on behalf of the communities that need our help.\nAdvocating in U.S. Congress\nWe are urging Congress and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to improve access to evidence-based treatment for obesity.
